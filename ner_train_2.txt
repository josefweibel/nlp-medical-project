CC:, Progressive unsteadiness following head trauma.,HX:,  A7 7 y/o male fell, as he was getting out of bed, and struck his head, 4 weeks prior to admission. He then began to experience progressive unsteadiness and gait instability for several days after the fall. He was then evaluated at a local ER and prescribed meclizine. This did not improve his symptoms, and over the past one week prior to admission began to develop left facial/LUE/LLE weakness.

Fetal heart tones are 130s with moderate long-term variability.  No paper is available for the fetal heart monitor due to the misorder and audibly sounds reassuring.,GENERAL:  Appears sedated, trashing intermittently, and then falling asleep in mid sentence.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.,PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,BACK:  Tender to palpation in her lower back bilaterally, but no CVA tenderness.,ABDOMEN:  Tender to palpation in left lower quadrant.

TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Lateral and plantar condylectomy, fifth left metatarsal.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Monitored anesthesia care with 10 mL of 1:1 mixture of both 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain.,HEMOSTASIS:,  30 minutes, left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 mL.,MATERIALS USED: , 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl.,INJECTABLES:,  Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized.  The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved.  The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively.  The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited.  The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given pain medications and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.  She was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was will follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Tearing, eyelash encrustation with probable tear duct obstruction bilateral.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Distal nasolacrimal duct stenosis with obstruction, left eye.,2.  Distal nasolacrimal duct stenosis with obstruction, right eye.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Bilateral nasolacrimal probing.,ANESTHESIA: , Monitored anesthesia care along with mask sedation.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: , This young infant is a 19-month-old who has had persistent tearing and mild eyelash encrustation of each eye for many months.  Conservative measures at home have failed to completely resolve the symptoms.  He has been placed on previous antibiotics treatment for presumed conjunctivitis.  Please refer to clinic note for more details.  Conservative measures at home have failed to resolve the symptoms.  A nasolacrimal probing was offered as an elective procedure.  Procedure as well as inherent risks, expected outcomes, benefits, and alternatives (including continued observation) were discussed with his mother prior to scheduling surgery.  Again, a description of procedure as well as diagram instruction was provided to mother and father in the morning of the procedure.  The risks as explained included, but were not limited to temporary bleeding, persistent symptoms, recurrence need for further procedure, possible need for future stent placement or repeat probing, and anesthesia risk were all discussed.  Also a rare possibility of errant passage of the nasolacrimal probe was discussed.  Preoperative evaluation and explanation include drying of the nasolacrimal system with an explanation expected outcome/result from surgery.  No guarantees were offered.  Informed consent was signed and placed on the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  Procedure as well as inherent risks were again discussed with parents prior to the procedure.  After anesthesia was induced in the operating room, tetracaine drops were applied to each eye and the pressure of the eyes were checked with Tono-Pen.  The pressure on the right was 17 mmHg and on the left was 16 mmHg.,A punctal dilator was then used to dilate the left superior puncta.  A size 00 Bowman probe was used to navigate the superior puncta and canaliculus with traction of the eyelid temporally.  The probe was advanced until a firm stop of the lacrimal bone was felt.  The probe was rotated in a superior and medial fashion along the brow to allow for navigation through the nasolacrimal sac and duct.  A mild resistance was felt at the distal aspect of the nasolacrimal duct consistent with a location of the valve.  There was also some mild stenosis distally, but not felt significant.  The probe was used to navigate through this mild resistance.  A second Bowman probe was then placed through the left naris and metal on metal contact was felt confirming patency.  Both probes were removed.  The 00 Bowman probe was then used to navigate the inferior puncta canaliculus system.  Patency was confirmed.  The left upper lid was everted and inspected and was found to be normal.,Attention was then turned to the right side where the similar procedure through the right superior puncta was performed.  A punctal dilator was used to dilate the puncta followed by a size 00 Bowman probe.  Again on this side, a size 0 Bowman probe was unable to be placed initially to the superior puncta.  The probe was used to navigate the superior puncta, canaliculus, and then the probe was rotated superomedially and the probe was advanced.  Similar amount of distal stenosis and distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction was felt.  The mild resistance was over come at the approximate location of the valve.  Metal-on-metal feel confirmed patency through the right naris with a second metal probe.  At the completion of the procedure all probes were removed.  Awakened and taken to the postanesthesia recovery unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Postoperative instructions were provided to the parents by me, and the discharging nurse.  I did advised nasolacrimal massage for the next 7 to 10 days on each side two to three times daily.  Technique explained and demonstrated.  Erythromycin ointment to both eyes twice daily for three days.  Follow up was arranged and he may call with any further questions or concerns."
