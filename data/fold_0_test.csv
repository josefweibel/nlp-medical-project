"A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve.  This was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation was good.  The ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of terminal ileum was inspected and was normal.  The colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Unfortunately her husband left her 10 days prior to admission and she developed severe anxiety and depression.  She was having chest pains along with significant vomiting and diarrhea.  Of note, she had a nuclear stress test performed in February of this year, which was normal.  She was readmitted to the hospital to rule out myocardial infarction and for further evaluation.,ADMISSION PHYSICAL: , Significant for her being afebrile.  Apparently there was one temperature registered mildly high at 100.  Her blood pressure was 140/82, heart rate 83, oxygen saturation was 100%.  She was tearful.  HEART:  Heart sounds were regular.

Rheumatoid arthritis.,4.  Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.

"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:,  None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008.  Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.

"ALLOWED CONDITIONS:,  Left knee strain, meniscus tear left knee.,CONTESTED CONDITION:,  Osteoarthritis of the left knee.,EMPLOYER:,  ABCD.,I examined Xxxxx today September 14, 2007, for the above allowed conditions and also the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.  He is a 57-year-old assembly worker who was injured on June 13, 2007, which according to his FROI was due to ""repairing cars, down on knees to work on concrete floors.""  In addition, he slipped on an air hose on the floor at work on March 7, 2007, re-injuring his left knee.  He developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.,After his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.,Examination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.,QUESTION: , Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx's current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.,ANSWER:, Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.,QUESTION:  ,Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?,ANSWER:, Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.,QUESTION:,  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, and diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER: ,Yes.  Please see the discussion in the answer to question no one.  In addition, x-rays of July 16, 2007, do reveal medial compartment and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis of the left knee.,QUESTION: , If you find this condition exists, is it a direct and proximate result of the June 13, 2002, injury?,ANSWER:, Yes.  See discussion in answer to question number one.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Xxxxx's injury or disability was caused by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of body?,ANSWER: ,No.  I believe the osteoarthritis was the result of the torn medial meniscus as discussed under question number one.,QUESTION: , In addition, if you find the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries, which could have contributed to Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER:, No.  He does not give any history of any intervening injuries.,If you opine the requested condition should be additionally recognized, please include the condition as an allowed condition in the discussion of the following questions.,QUESTION:,  Based on the objective findings is the request for 10 sessions of physical therapy per C-9 dated July 27, 2007, medically necessary and appropriate for the allowed conditions of the claim of osteoarthritis of left knee?,ANSWER:,  Yes.,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"ALLOWED CONDITIONS:,  Sprain of left knee and leg.,CONTESTED CONDITION:,  Left knee tear medial meniscus, left knee ACL tear.,EMPLOYER:,  YYYY,REQUESTING PARTY:,  XXXX,Mr. XXXXXX is a xx-year-old male who was evaluated for an independent medical examination on September 20, 2007, because of an injury sustained to the left leg.  The injured worker does state that he was working as a processor for the ABCD Company on July 18, 2007, when he injured his left knee.  He does state he was working in a catwalk when he stepped up.  He noticed his sight glass was not open on the tank.  He then stepped straight down and his knee went sideways.  His knee popped and he sat down secondary to discomfort.  At that time he could not do any type of activity secondary to the pain.  The nurse called the ambulance subsequent to this injury and he was taken to Bethesda North.  X-rays were obtained which demonstrated no evidence of fracture.  Thereafter, he was referred to X who he saw on July 19, 2007.  It was felt that a MRI scan about the knee needed to be obtained and it was obtained on July 24.  It was noted that there was evidence of an anterior cruciate ligament tear and a slight medial meniscal tear.  On his second visit, it was felt that arthroscopic surgery intervention was indicated as related to the left knee.,On September 7, 2007, he underwent surgical intervention at ABC for the anterior cruciate reconstruction as well as the partial medial meniscectomy.,At the present time, he is progressing along with physical therapy.  He is utilizing one crutch.,He does admit to significant bruising and swelling about the left lower extremity.  If he does indeed move too fast, the discomfort is increased.  His pain about the left knee is approximately 6 to 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.,He has had injuries to the right knee in which he wrecked his bicycle and did have some type of fracture bone spur when he was 13 years of age.,He underwent arthroscopic surgery as related to the right knee at that time and really did quite well.,His next appointment with Dr. X is on October 4, 2007.,The injured worker denies any previous history of similar problems as related to the left knee.,MEDICATIONS: , Glucophage, Lipitor, Actos, Benicar, glimepiride, and Januvia.,SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Arthroscopic surgery of the left knee and arthroscopic surgery of the right knee.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient denies alcohol consumption.

His education is that of 12th grade.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , This is a healthy appearing 34-year-old male who is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 285 pounds.  He does not appear to be in distress at this time.  Examination is limited to the left knee.  One could appreciate a healed scar as related to the inferior pole inferior to the patella.  There are healed arthroscopic scars as well.  The range of motion of left knee reveals 50 to 70 degrees of flexion.  There is evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  Anterior Lachman's test was negative.  No evidence of atrophy is noted.  There is weakness with aggressive function about the quadriceps and hamstring musculature.,The patient is ambulating with one crutch at this time.,There is mild degree of swelling as related to the left knee.  Deep tendon reflexes are +2/+2 bilaterally symmetrical.  Sensory examination was normal as related to the foot, but abnormal as related to the left knee.,I did review pictures that were taken at the time of the surgery, which demonstrates the meniscectomy and the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEW:,1.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee demonstrated evidence of a small suprapatellar joint effusion.  It should be noted that the exam demonstrated evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  There was specific mention of intraarticular effusion.,2.  On July 27, 2007, MRI scan of the left knee was obtained, which demonstrated evidence of the complete tear of the mid to distal ACL.  Findings suggestive of a chronic injury.  Grade I sprain of the MCL was noted.  Contusion __________ plateau medial femoral condyle and lateral femoral condyle was noted.  There was evidence of a small peripheral longitudinal tear of the posterior horn of medial meniscus.  Chondromalacia of the lateral femoral condyle and patella was noted.  It should be noted that the changes of degeneration of the cartilages of the injured worker's knee and the chronic anterior cruciate ligament changes were noted related to the July 18, 2007, injury.,3.  July 18, 2007, first report of injury, occupational disease, and/or death.,4.  Evaluations of ABCD Hospital.  It should be noted that the mechanism of injury was such that he was walking down the stairs when his left knee locked up.,5.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee were obtained, which demonstrated the evidence of no acute fracture or significant osteoarthritis.  There is evidence there maybe a small suprapatellar joint effusion.,6.  Notes from the office of Dr. X. It should be noted on physical examination his range of motion is 8 to 20 degrees.,7.

This was felt __________ pre-injury MRI scan.,Following your review of the medical information and your physical examination, please answer the following questions as these pertain to the allowed conditions.  Please express your opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical probability.,QUESTION: ,Mr. XXXXXX has filed an application for the additional allowance of left knee tear of the medial meniscus and left knee ACL tear.,Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, or and medical records or diagnosis studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of any of the requested conditions.,ANSWER: ,The MRI sustains and verifies that these conditions do indeed exist subsequent to the injury of July 18, 2007.,QUESTION: ,If you find any of these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.,ANSWER: ,There is mention of degeneration as related to the knee prior to this episode.  This is not surprising considering the individual's weight.  There is no question degeneration as related to anterior cruciate ligament and the meniscus has been occurring for a lengthy period of time.  There has been an aggravation of this condition.  Without having a MRI to review prior to this injury, I believe, it would be safe to assume that there has been aggravation of a pre-existing condition as related to the left knee and __________ meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament pathology.  Thus there is definitely evidence of an aggravation of a pre-existing condition but not necessarily a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.,QUESTION: ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"BNP, (brain natriuretic peptide or B-type natriuretic peptide) is a substance produced in the  heart ventricles when there is excessive strain to the heart muscles.  A blood test for this can be used as an effective parameter for detecting an acute event of congestive heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump sufficient amount of blood required by the body's needs.  When a person has a heart failure (such as MI), BNP is secreted so immensely that it sits well above the measurable range.  Values above 100 signal a problematic situation and those above 500 a highly demanding state.  Note that a person with a remote history of heart problems may not have BNP levels elevated, but it is used as a measure of acute events.,On the other hand, ,BMP, or basic metabolic panel is not a single test but a group of 8 tests (glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, BUN, creatinine).  Any test that has the word panel in it is not a single test, so cannot have a single value.,With this logic in mind, if a doctor uses phrases like ""BNP/BMP is elevated/negative/positive/is greater than/less than etc."" and then a single value, it may not be BMP.  You can also take the hint from the file whether the patient presented to the hospital with an acute coronary event.  Likewise, if he says multiple values for this test, this must be BMP.,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Penile cellulitis status post circumcision.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 16-month-old boy, who had a circumcision performed approximately 4 days before he developed penile swelling and fever and discharge.  The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin.  He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago.  The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103.  He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care.  Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant.  He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother.  I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis.  The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient has no known allergies.  He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery.  Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions.  No other hospitalizations.  He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned.  He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with both parents and no siblings.  There are smokers at home.,MEDICATIONS: , Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment.  Also Bactrim.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 14.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.,HEAD AND NECK:  Grossly normal.  His neck and chest are without masses.,NARES:  He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft without masses or tenderness.,GU:  He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema.  There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection.  He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans.  The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time.  The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness.  Both testes were descended without hydroceles.,EXTREMITIES:  He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,BACK:  Normal.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis.  This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities.  I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad.  I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day.  I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely.  Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.  He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist  and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The patient also had greater than 300 of the protein reading, moderate leukocytes, 30-50 white blood cells, but no bacteria were seen.  Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: , The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect.  The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.  The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.,DIAGNOSES,1.  HEMATURIA.,2.  PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.,3.  SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.,4.

During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded.  His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode.  He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable.

TIA.  The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation.  Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection.  He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system.  He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued.  Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup.  The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time.,2.  Lumbar stenosis.  His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Achilles ruptured tendon.,HISTORY:,  Mr. XYZ is 41 years of age, who works for Chevron and lives in Angola.  He was playing basketball in Angola back last Wednesday, Month DD, YYYY, when he was driving toward the basket and felt a pop in his posterior leg.  He was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture.  He has been on crutches and has been nonweightbearing since that time.  He had no pain prior to his injury.  He has had some swelling that is mild.  He has just been on aspirin a day due to his traveling time.  Pain currently is minimal.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Denies diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Malarone, which is an anti-malarial.,ALLERGIES:,  NKDA,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is a petroleum engineer for Chevron.  Drinks socially.  Does not use tobacco.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,  Pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  He has some mild swelling on the right ankle and hindfoot.  He has motion that is increased into dorsiflexion.  He has good plantarflexion.  Good subtalar, Chopart and forefoot motion.  His motor function is intact although weak into plantarflexion.  Sensation is intact.  Pulses are strong.  In the prone position, he has diminished tension on the affected side.  There is some bruising around the posterior heel.  He has a palpable defect about 6-8 cm proximal to the insertion site that is tender for him.

Radiographs of the heel show no fracture noted with good alignment.,IMPRESSION:,  Right Achilles tendon rupture.,PLAN:,  I have gone over with Mr. XYZ the options available.  We have discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to operative versus nonoperative treatment.  Based on his age and his activity level, I think his best option is for operative fixation.  We went over the risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, rerupture of the tendon, weakness and the need for future surgery.  We have discussed doing this as an outpatient procedure.  He would be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, nonweightbearing in a dynamic brace for 4 weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months postop when we can get him into a shoe with a ¼"" lift.  He understands a 6-9 month return to sports overall.  He will also need to be on some Lovenox for a week after surgery and then on an aspirin as he is going to travel back to Angola.  Today we will put him in a high tide boot that he will need at six weeks, and we will put him in a 1"" lift also.  He can weight bear until surgery and we will have it set up this week.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Intractable epilepsy, here for video EEG.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 9-year-old male who has history of global developmental delay and infantile spasms.  Ultimately, imaging study shows an MRI with absent genu of the corpus callosum and thinning of the splenium of the corpus callosum, showing a pattern of cerebral dysgenesis.  He has had severe global developmental delay, and is nonverbal.  He can follow objects with his eyes, but has no ability to interact with his environment to any great degree.  He has noted if any purposeful use of the hands.  He has abnormal movements constantly, which are more choreiform and dystonic.  He has spastic quadriparesis, which is variable at times.  The patient is unable to sit or stand, and receives all his nutrition via G-tube.,The patient began having seizures in infancy presenting as infantile spasms.  I began seeing him at 20 months of age.  At that point, he had undergone workup in Seattle, Washington and then was seeing Dr. X, child neurologist in Mexico, who started Vigabatrin for infantile spasms.  The patient had benefit from this medication, and was doing well at that time with regard to that seizure type.  He initially was on phenobarbital, which failed to give him benefit.  He continued on phenobarbital; however, for a long period time thereafter.  The patient then began having more tonic seizures after his episodic spasms had subsided, and failed several medication trials including valproic acid, Topamax, and Zonegran at least briefly.  Upon starting Lamictal, he began to have benefit and then actually had 1-year seizure freedom before having an isolated seizure or 2.  Over the next 6 months to a year, he only had few further seizures, and was doing well in a general sense.  It was more recently that he began having new seizure events that have not responded to higher doses of Lamictal up to 15 mg/kg/day.  These events manifest as tonic spells with eye deviation and posturing.  Mother reports flexion of the upper extremities, extension with lower extremities.  During that time, he is not able to cry or say any sounds.  These events last from seconds to minutes, and occur at least multiple times per week.  There are times where he has none for a few days and other times where he has multiple days in a row with events.  He has another event manifesting as flexion of the upper extremities and extension lower extremities where he turns red and cries throughout.  He may vomit after these episodes, then seems to calm down.  It is unclear whether this is a seizure or whether the patient is still responsive.,MEDICATIONS:,  The patient's medications include Lamictal for a total of 200 mg twice a day.  It is a 150 mg tablet and 25 mg tablets.  He is on Zonegran using 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice daily, and baclofen 10 mg three times day.  He has other medications including the Xopenex and Atrovent.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time is negative any fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, rashes, arthritis, or arthralgias.  No respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  He has no change in his skills at this point.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a slender male who is microcephalic.  He has EEG electrodes in place and is on the video EEG at that time.,HEENT:  His oropharynx shows no lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.,ABDOMEN:  Benign with G-tube in place.,EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.,NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is alert and has bilateral esotropia.  He is able to fix and follow objects briefly.  He is unable to reach for objects.  He exhibits constant choreiform movements when excited.  These are more prominent in the upper extremities and lower extremities.  He has some dystonic posture with flexion of the wrist and fingers bilaterally.  He also has plantar flexion at the ankles bilaterally.  His cranial nerves reveal that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact other than bilateral esotropia.  His face moves symmetrically.  Palate elevates in midline.  Hearing appears intact bilaterally.,Motor exam reveals dystonic and variable tone, overall there is mild in spasticity both upper and lower extremities as described above.  He has clonus at the ankles bilaterally, and some valgus contracture of the ankles.  His sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 to 3+ bilaterally.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , This is a 9-year-old male with congenital brain malformation and intractable epilepsy.  He has microcephaly as well as dystonic cerebral palsy.  He had a re-emergence of seizures, which are difficult to classify, although some sound like tonic episodes and others are more concerning for non-epileptic phenomenon, such as discomfort.  He is admitted for video EEG to hopefully capture both of these episodes and further clarify the seizure type or types.  He will remain hospitalized for probably at least 48 hours to 72 hours.  He could be discharged sooner if multiple events are captured.  His medications, we will continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now.  Both of these medications are very long acting, discontinuing them while in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort.  These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her.  She feels anxious and worried.  She does not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.  She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS: , Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight:  140 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/90.  Pulse:  102.  Respirations:  18.  Age:  27.,PLAN:,  We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion.  She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today’s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday’s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,:  She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.  If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Chief Complaint:, Back and hip pain.,History of Present Illness:, The patient is a 73 year old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease secondary to reflux nephropathy / restriction of bladder neck requiring hemodialysis and eventual cadaveric renal transplant now on chronic immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease with non-healing ulcer of right great toe, and peripheral neuropathy who initially presented to his primary care physician in May 2001 with complaints of low back pain and bilateral hip pain. The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics,In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient’s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

"DATE OF INJURY : October 4, 2000,DATE OF EXAMINATION : September 5, 2003,EXAMINING PHYSICIAN : X Y, MD,Prior to the beginning of the examination, it is explained to the examinee that this examination is intended for evaluative purposes only, and that it is not intended to constitute a general medical examination. It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor-patient relationship does not apply to this examination, and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination. It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance, in order to avoid injury.,CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Aching and mid back pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT INJURY: , Based upon the examinee's perspective: ,Mr. Abc is a 52-year-old self-employed, independent consultant for DEMILEE-USA. He is also a mechanical engineer. He reports that he was injured in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in October 4, 2000. At that time, he was employed as a purchasing agent for IBIKEN-USA. On the date of the motor vehicle accident, he was sitting in the right front passenger's seat, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, in his 1996 or 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon automobile driven by his son. The vehicle was completely stopped and was ""slammed from behind"" by a van. The police officer, who responded to the accident, told Mr. Abc that the van was probably traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour at the time of impact.,During the impact, Mr. Abc was restrained in the seat and did not contact the interior surface of the vehicle. He experienced immediate mid back pain. He states that the Volvo automobile sustained approximately $4600 in damage.,He was transported by an ambulance, secured by a cervical collar and backboard to the emergency department. An x-ray of the whole spine was obtained, and he was evaluated by a physician's assistant. He was told that it would be ""okay to walk."" He was prescribed pain pills and told to return for reevaluation if he experienced increasing pain.,He returned to the Kaiser facility a few days later, and physical therapy was prescribed. Mr. Abc states that he was told that ""these things can take a long time."" He indicates that after one year he was no better. He then states that after two years he was no better and worried if the condition would never get better.,He indicates he saw an independent physician, a general practitioner, and an MRI was ordered. The MRI study was completed at ABCD Hospital. Subsequently, Mr. Abc returned and was evaluated by a physiatrist. The physiatrist reexamined the original thoracic spine x-rays that were taken on October 4, 2000, and stated that he did not know why the radiologist did not originally observe vertebral compression fractures. Mr. Abc believes that he was told by the physiatrist that it involved either T6-T7 or T7-T8.,Mr. Abc reports that the physiatrist told him that little could be done besides participation in core strengthening. Mr. Abc describes his current exercise regimen, consisting of cycling, and it was deemed to be adequate. He was told, however, by the physiatrist that he could also try a Pilates type of core exercise program.,The physiatrist ordered a bone scan, and Mr. Abc is unsure of the results. He does not have a formal follow up scheduled with Kaiser, and is awaiting re-contact by the physiatrist.,He denies any previous history of symptomatology or injuries involving his back.,CURRENT SYMPTOMS:  ,He reports that he has the same mid back pain that has been present since the original injury. It is located in the same area, the mid thoracic spine area. It is described as a pain and an ache and ranges from 3/10 to 6/10 in intensity, and the intensity varies, seeming to go in cycles. The pain has been staying constant.,When I asked whether or not the pain have improved, he stated that he was unable to determine whether or not he had experienced improvement. He indicates that there may be less pain, or conversely, that he may have developed more of a tolerance for the pain. He further states that ""I can power through it."" ""I have learned how to manage the pain, using exercise, stretching, and diversion techniques."" It is primary limitation with regards to the back pain involves prolonged sitting. After approximately two hours of sitting, he has required to get up and move around, which results in diminishment of the pain. He indicates that prior to the motor vehicle accident, he could sit for significantly longer periods of time, 10 to 12 hours on a regular basis, and up to 20 hours, continuously, on an occasional basis.,He has never experienced radiation of the pain from the mid thoracic spine, and he has never experienced radicular symptoms of radiation of pain into the extremities, numbness, tingling, or weakness.,Again, aggravating activities include prolonged sitting, greater than approximately two hours.,Alleviating activities include moving around, stretching, and exercising. Also, if he takes ibuprofen, it does seem to help with the back pain.,He is not currently taking medications regularly, but list that he takes occasional ibuprofen when the pain is too persistent.,He indicates that he received several physical therapy sessions for treatment, and was instructed in stretching and exercises. He has subsequently performed the prescribed stretching and exercises daily, for nearly three years.,With regards to recreational activities, he states that he has not limited his activities due to his back pain.,He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction.,FILES REVIEW:  ,October 4, 2000: An ambulance was dispatched to the scene of a motor vehicle accident on South and Partlow Road. The EMS crew arrived to find a 49-year-old male sitting in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that was damaged in a rear-end collision and appeared to have minimal damage. He was wearing a seatbelt and he denied loss of consciousness. He also denied a pertinent past medical history. They noted pain in the lower cervical area, mid thoracic and lumbar area. They placed him on a backboard and transported him to Medical Center.,October 4, 2000: He was seen in the emergency department of Medical Center. The provider is described as ""unknown."" The history from the patient was that he was the passenger in the front seat of a car that was stopped and rear-ended. He stated that he did not exit the car because of pain in his upper back. He reported he had been wearing the seatbelt and harness at that time. He denied a history of back or neck injuries. He was examined on a board and had a cervical collar in place. He was complaining of mid back pain. He denied extremity weakness. Sensory examination was intact. There was no tenderness with palpation or flexion in the neck. The back was a little tender in the upper thoracic spine area without visible deformity. There were no marks on the back. His x-ray was described as ""no acute bony process."" Listed visit diagnosis was a sprain-thoracic, and he was prescribed hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets and Motrin 800 mg tablets.,October 4, 2000: During the visit, a Clinician's Report of Disability document was signed by Dr. M, authorizing time loss from October 4, 2000, through October 8, 2000. The document also advised no heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, or overhead work for two weeks. During this visit, a thoracic spine x-ray series, two views, was obtained and read by Dr. JR. The findings demonstrate no evidence of acute injury. No notable arthritic findings. The pedicles and paravertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable.,November 21, 2000: An outpatient progress note was completed at Kaiser, and the clinician of record was Dr. H. The history obtained documents that Mr. Abc continued to experience the same pain that he first noted after the accident, described as a discomfort in the mid thoracic spine area. It was non-radiating and described as a tightness. He also reported that he was hearing clicking noises that he had not previously heard. He denied loss of strength in the arms. The physical examination revealed good strength and normal deep tendon reflexes in the arms. There was minimal tenderness over T4 through T8, in an approximate area. The visit diagnosis listed was back pain. Also described in the assessment was residual pain from MVA, suspected bruised muscles. He was prescribed Motrin 800 mg tablets and an order was sent to physical therapy. Dr. N also documents that if the prescribed treatment measures were not effective, then he would suggest a referral to a physiatrist. Also, the doctor wanted him to discuss with physical therapy whether or not they thought that a chiropractor would be beneficial.,December 4, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Philippe Justel, physical therapist. The history obtained from Mr. Abc is that he was not improving. Symptoms described were located in the mid back, centrally. The examination revealed mild tenderness, centrally at T3-T8, with very poor segmental mobility. The posture was described as rigid T/S in flexion. Range of motion was described as within normal limits, without pain at the cervical spine and thoracic spine. The plan listed included two visits per week for two weeks, for mobilization. It is also noted that the physical therapist would contact the MD regarding a referral to a chiropractor.,December 8, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Mr. Justel. It was noted that the subjective category of the document revealed that there was no real change. It was noted that Mr. Abc tolerated the treatment well and that he was to see a chiropractor on Monday.,December 11, 2000: He presented to the Chiropractic Wellness Center. There is a form titled 'Chiropractic Case History,' and it documents that Mr. Abc was involved in a motor vehicle accident, in which he was rear-ended in October. He has had mid back pain since that time. The pain is worsened with sitting, especially at a computer. The pain decreases when he changes positions, and sometimes when he walks. Mr. Abc reports that he occasionally takes 800 mg doses of ibuprofen. He reported he went to physical therapy treatment on two occasions, which helped for a few hours only. He did report that he had a previous history of transitory low back pain.,During the visit, he completed a modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and a WC/PI Subjective Complaint Form. He listed complaints of mid and low back pain of a sore and aching character. He rated the pain at grade 3-5/10, in intensity. He reported difficulty with sitting at a table, bending forward, or stooping. He reported that the pain was moderate and comes and goes.,During the visit at the Chiropractic Wellness Center, a spinal examination form was completed. It documents palpation tenderness in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine area and also palpation tenderness present in the suboccipital area, scalenes, and trapezia. Active cervical range of motion measured with goniometry reveals pain and restriction in all planes. Active thoracic range of motion measured with inclinometry revealed pain and restriction in rotation bilaterally. Active lumbosacral range of motion measured with inclinometry reveals pain with lumbar extension, right lateral flexion, and left lateral flexion.,December 11, 2000: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment, and he was advised to return for further treatment at a frequency of twice a week.,December 13, 2000: He returned to the Chiropractic Wellness Center to see Joe Smith, DC, and it is documented that his middle back was better.,December 13, 2000: A personal injury patient history form is completed at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. Mr. Abc reported that on October 4, 2000, he was driving his 1996 Volvo 850 vehicle, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, and completely stopped. He was rear-ended by a vehicle traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour. The impact threw him back into his seat, and he felt back pain and determined that it was not wise to move about. He reported approximate damage to his vehicle of $4800. He reported continuing mid and low back pain, of a dull and semi-intense nature. He reported that he was an export company manager for IBIKEN-USA, and that he missed two full days of work, and missed 10-plus partial days of work. He stated that he was treated initially after the motor vehicle accident at Kaiser and received painkillers and ibuprofen, which relieved the pain temporarily. He specifically denied ever experiencing similar symptoms.,December 26, 2000: A no-show was documented at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 5, 2001: He received treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that two weeks previously, his mid back pain had worsened.,April 12, 2001: He received chiropractic treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 16, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 19, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 26, 2001: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that his mid back pain increased with sitting at the computer. At the conclusion of this visit, he was advised to return to the clinic as needed.,September 6, 2002: An MRI of the thoracic spine was completed at ABCD Hospital and read by Dr. RL, radiologist. Dr. D noted the presence of minor anterior compression of some mid thoracic vertebrae of indeterminate age, resulting in some increased kyphosis. Some of the mid thoracic discs demonstrate findings consistent with degenerative disc disease, without a significant posterior disc bulging or disc herniation. There are some vertebral end-plate abnormalities, consistent with small Schmorl's nodes, one on the superior aspect of T7, which is compressed anteriorly, and on the inferior aspect of T6.,May 12, 2003: He was seen at the Outpatient Clinic by Dr. L, internal medicine specialist. He was there for a health screening examination, and listed that his only complaints are for psoriasis and chronic mid back pain, which have been present since a 2000 motor vehicle accident. Mr. Abc reported that an outside MRI showed compression fractures in the thoracic spine. The history further documents that Mr. Abc is an avid skier and volunteers on the ski patrol. The physical examination revealed that he was a middle-aged Caucasian male in no acute distress. The diagnosis listed from this visit is back pain and psoriasis. Dr. L documented that he spent one hour in the examination room with the patient discussing what was realistic and reasonable with regard to screening testing. Dr. L also stated that since Mr. Abc was experiencing chronic back pain, he advised him to see a physiatrist for evaluation. He was instructed to bring the MRI to the visit with that practitioner.,June 10, 2003: He was seen at the Physiatry Clinic by Dr. R, physiatrist. The complaint listed is mid back pain. In the subjective portion of the chart note, Dr. R notes that Mr. Abc is involved in the import/export business, and that he is physically active in cycling, skiing, and gardening. He is referred by Dr. L because of persistent lower thoracic pain, following a motor vehicle accident, on October 4, 2000. Mr. Abc told Dr. R that he was the restrained passenger of a vehicle that was rear-ended at a moderate speed. He stated that he experienced immediate discomfort in his thoracic spine area without radiation. He further stated that thoracic spine x-rays were obtained at the Sunnyside Emergency Room and read as normal. It is noted that Mr. Abc was treated conservatively and then referred to physical therapy where he had a number of visits in late of 2002 and early 2003. No further chart entries were documented about the back problem until Mr. Abc complained to Dr. L that he still had ongoing thoracic spine pain during a visit the previous month. He obtained an MRI, out of pocket, at ABCD Hospital and stated that he paid $1100 for it. Dr. R asked to see the MRI and was told by Mr. Abc that he would have to reimburse or pay him $1100 first. He then told the doctor that the interpretation was that he had a T7 and T8 compression fracture. Mr. Abc reported his improvement at about 20%, compared to how he felt immediately after the accident. He described that his only symptoms are an aching pain that occurs after sitting for four to five hours. If he takes a break from sitting and walks around, his symptoms resolve. He is noted to be able to bike, ski, and be active in his garden without any symptoms at all. He denied upper extremity radicular symptoms. He denied lower extremity weakness or discoordination. He also denied bowel or bladder control or sensation issues. Dr. R noted that Mr. Abc was hostile about the Kaiser health plan and was quite uncommunicative, only reluctantly revealing his history. The physical examination revealed that he moved about the examination room without difficulty and exhibited normal lumbosacral range of motion. There was normal thoracic spine motion with good chest expansion. Neurovascular examination of the upper extremities was recorded as normal. There was no spasticity in the lower extremities. There was no tenderness to palpation or percussion up and down the thoracic spine. Dr. R reviewed the thoracic spine films and noted the presence of ""a little compression of what appears to be T7 and T8 on the lateral view."" Dr. R observed that this was not noted on the original x-ray interpretation. He further stated that the MRI, as noted above, was not available for review. Dr. R assessed that Mr. Abc was experiencing minimal thoracic spine complaints that probably related to the motor vehicle accident three years previously. The doctor further stated that ""the patient's symptoms are so mild as to almost not warrant intervention."" He discussed the need to make sure that Mr. Abc's workstation was ergonomic and that Mr. Abc could pursue core strengthening. He further recommended that Mr. Abc look into participation in a Pilates class. Mr. Abc was insistent, so Dr. R made plans to order a bone scan to further discriminate the etiology of his symptoms. He advised Mr. Abc that the bone scan results would probably not change treatment. As a result of this visit, Dr. R diagnosed thoracic spine pain (724.1) and ordered a bone scan study.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

She was on bedrest since her 34th week.  She also has a history of tobacco abuse with asthma.  She was admitted here and labor was confirmed with rupture of membranes.  She was initially 5, 70%, -1.  Her bag was ruptured, IUPC was placed.  She received an epidural for pain control and Pitocin augmentation was performed.  She progressed for several hours to complete and to push, then pushed for approximately 15 minutes to deliver a vigorous female infant from OA presentation.  Delivery of the head was manual assisted.  The shoulders and the rest of body then followed without difficulty.  Baby was bulb suctioned, had a vigorous cry.  Cord was clamped twice and cut and the infant was handed to the awaiting nursing team.  Placenta then delivered spontaneously and intact, was noted to have a three-vessel cord.  The inspection of the perineum revealed it to be intact.  There was a hymenal remnant/skin tag that was protruding from the vaginal introitus.  I discussed this with the patient.  She opted to have it removed.  This was performed and I put a single interrupted suture 3-0 Vicryl for hemostasis.  Further inspection revealed bilateral superficial labial lacerations that were hemostatic and required no repair.  Overall EBL is 300 mL.  Mom and baby are currently doing well.

"DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pneumonia.,2.  Crohn disease.,3.  Anasarca.,4.  Anemia.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , I have a lot of swelling in my legs.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a long history of Crohn disease.  He has been followed by Dr. ABC, his primary care doctor, but he states that he has had multiple gastroenterology doctors and has not seen one in the past year to 18 months.  He has been treated with multiple different medications for his Crohn disease and most recently has been taking pulses of steroids off and on when he felt like he was having symptoms consistent with crampy abdominal pain, increased diarrhea, and low-grade fevers.  This has helped in the past, but now he developed symptoms consistent with pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital.  He has been treated with IV antibiotics and is growing Streptococcus.  At this time, he seems relatively stable although slightly dyspneic.  Other symptoms include lower extremity edema, pain in his ankles and knees, and actually symptoms of edema in his entire body including his face and upper extremities.  At this time, he continues to have symptoms consistent with diarrhea and malabsorption.  He also has some episodes of nausea and vomiting at times.  He currently has a cough and symptoms of dyspnea.  Further review of systems was not otherwise contributory.,MEDICATIONS:,1.  Prednisone.,2.  Effexor.,3.  Folic acid.,4.  Norco for pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , As mentioned above, but he also has anxiety and depression.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.  Small bowel resections.,2.  Appendectomy.,3.  A vasectomy.,ALLERGIES:  ,He has no known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He does smoke two packs of cigarettes per day.  He has no alcohol or drug use.  He is a painter.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Significant for his father who died of IPF and irritable bowel syndrome.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , As mentioned in the history of present illness and further review of systems is not otherwise contributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  He is a thin appearing man in very mild respiratory distress when his oxygen is off.,VITAL SIGNS:  His respiratory rate is approximately 18 to 20, his blood pressure is 100/70, his pulse is 90 and regular, he is afebrile currently at 96, and weight is approximately 163 pounds.,HEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae normal.  Nasal and oropharynx are clear.,NECK:  Supple.  No jugular venous pressure distention is noted.  There is no adenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular or axillary areas.,CHEST:  Reveals some crackles in the right chest, in the base, and in the upper lung fields.  His left is relatively clear with decreased breath sounds.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Slightly protuberant.  Bowel sounds are present.  He is slightly tender and it is diffuse.  There is no organomegaly and no ascites appreciable.,EXTREMITIES:  There is a mild scrotal edema and in his lower extremities he has 2 to 3+ edema at pretibial and lateral feet.,DERMATOLOGIC:  Shows thin skin.  No ecchymosis or petechiae.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , Laboratory studies are pertinent for a total protein of 3 and albumin of 1.3.  There is no M-spike observed.  His B12 is 500 with a folic acid of 11.  His white count is 21 with a hemoglobin of 10, and a platelet count 204,000.,IMPRESSION AT THIS TIME:,1.  Pneumonia in the face of fairly severe Crohn disease with protein-losing enteropathy and severe malnutrition with anasarca.,2.  He also has anemia and leukocytosis, which may be related to his Crohn disease as well as his underlying pneumonia.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , At this time, I believe evaluation of protein intake and dietary supplement will be most appropriate.  I believe that he needs a calorie count.  We will check on a sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, LDH, prealbumin, thyroid, and iron studies in the morning with his laboratory studies that are already ordered.  I have recommended strongly to him that when he is out of the hospital, he return to the care of his gastroenterologist.  I will help in anyway that I can to improve the patient's laboratory abnormalities.  However, his lower extremity edema is primarily due to his marked hypoalbuminemia and I do not believe that diuretics will help him at this time.  I have explained this in detail to the patient and his family.  Everybody expresses understanding and all questions were answered.  At this time, follow him up during his hospital stay and plan to see him in the office as well.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Blood work consisted of a chemistry panel that was unremarkable, except for decreased proteins.  H&H was stable at 33.3/10.9 and platelets of 80,000.  White blood cell counts were normal, differential was normal.  TSH was 3.41.  Free T4 was 0.9.  Dr. X felt this was consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and recommended Synthroid replacement.  A cortisol level was obtained prior to administration of hydrocortisone.  This was 10.9 and that was not a fasting level.  Dr. X felt because of his hypothyroidism and his hypothermia that he had secondary adrenal insufficiency and recommended hydrocortisone and Florinef.  The patient was eventually changed to prednisone 2.5 mg b.i.d. in addition to his Florinef 0.1 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The patient was started back on his tube feeds.  He tolerated these poorly with residuals.  Reglan was increased to 10 mg q.6 h. and erythromycin is being added.  The patient's temperature has been stable in the 94 to 95 range.  Other vital signs have been stable.  His urine output has been diminished.  An external jugular line was placed in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's legal guardian, Janet Sanchez in Albuquerque has requested he be transported there.  As per several physicians in Albuquerque and Dr. Y, an internist, we will accept him once we have a nursing home available to him.  He is being transported back to the nursing home today and discharge planners are working on getting him a nursing home in Albuquerque.

"DIAGNOSIS: , Status post brain tumor with removal.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient is a 64-year-old female with previous medical history of breast cancer that has metastasized to her lung, liver, spleen, and brain, status post radiation therapy.  The patient stated that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed with subsequent left-sided weakness.  The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  The patient also complains of difficulty with word retrieval and slurring of speech.  The patient denies any difficulty with swallowing at this time.,OBJECTIVE:  ,Portions of the cognitive linguistic quick test was administered.  An oral mechanism exam was performed.  A motor speech protocol was completed.,The cognitive linguistic subtests of recalling personal facts, symbol cancellation, confrontational naming, clock drawing, story retelling, generative naming, design and memory, and completion of mazes was administered.,The patient was 100% accurate with recalling personal facts, completion of the symbol cancellation tasks, and with confrontational naming.  She had no difficulty with the clock drawing task; however, she has considerable hand tremors, which makes writing difficult.  In the storytelling task, she scored within normal limits.  She was also within normal limits for generative naming.  She did have difficulty with the design, memory, and mazes subtests.  She was unable to complete the second maze during the allotted time.  The design generation subtest was also completed.  She was able to draw four unique designs, and toward the end of the tasks was no longer able to recall the stated direction.,ORAL MECHANISM EXAMINATION:,  The patient has mild left facial droop with decreased nasolabial fold.  Tongue is at midline, and lingual range of motion and strength are within functional limit.  The patient does complain of biting her tongue on occasion, but denied biting the inside of her cheeks.  Her AMRs are judged to be within functional limit.  Her rate of speech is decreased with a monotonous vocal quality.  The decreased rate may be a compensation for decreased word retrieval ability.  The patient's speech is judged to be 100% intelligible without background noise.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient has mild cognitive linguistic deficits in the areas of higher level cognitive function seen in mental flexibility, memory, and executive function.,PLAN OF CARE:,  Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for four weeks to include cognitive linguistic treatment.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (THREE WEEKS):,1.

The patient woke up at 7: 15 a.m. on March 26 with the sudden onset of right-sided weakness of his arm, hand, leg and foot and also with a right facial droop, right hand numbness on the dorsal side, left face numbness and slurred speech. The patient was brought by EMS to emergency room. The patient was normal before he went to bed the prior night. He was given aspirin in the ER. The CT of the brain without contrast did not show any changes. He could not have a CT with contrast because the machine was broken. He went ahead and had the MRI/MRA of the brain and neck, which showed infarct involving the right basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe. Also, there is diffuse smooth narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery.,The patient was admitted to the MICU.,HOSPITAL COURSE PER PROBLEM LIST:,1. Acute cerebrovascular accident: The patient was not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator. A neurology consult was obtained from Dr. S. She agrees with our treatment for this patient. The patient was on aspirin 325 mg and also on Zocor 20 mg once a day. We also ordered fasting blood lipids, which showed cholesterol of 165, triglycerides 180, HDL cholesterol 22, LDL cholesterol 107. Dr. Farber agreed to treat the risk factors, to not treat blood pressure for the first two weeks of the stroke. We put the patient on p.r.n. labetalol only for systolic blood pressure greater than 200, diastolic blood pressure greater than 120. The patient's blood pressure has been stable and he did not need any blood pressure medications. His right leg kept improving with increased muscle strength and it was 4-5/5, however, his right upper extremity did not improve much and was 0-1/5. His slurred speech has been improved a little bit. The patient started PT, OT and speech therapy on the second day of hospitalization. The patient was transferred out to a regular floor on the same day of admission based on his stable neurologic exam. Also, we added Aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention, suggested by Dr. F. Echocardiogram was ordered and showed normal left ventricular function with bubble study that was negative. Carotid ultrasound only showed mild stenosis on the right side. EKG did not show any changes, so the patient will be transferred to Siskin Rehabilitation Hospital today on Aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention. He will not need blood pressure treatment unless systolic is greater than 220, diastolic greater than 120, for the first week of his stroke. On discharge, on his neurologic exam, he has a right facial palsy from the eye below, he has right upper extremity weakness with 0-1/5 muscle strength, right leg is 4-5/5, improved slurred speech.,2.

She denied history of chest pain or fevers or cough with purulent sputum at that time. She was empirically treated with a course of antibiotics of Avelox for ten days. She also received steroids, prednisolone 60 mg, and breathing treatments with albuterol, Ipratropium and her bronchodilator therapy was also optimized with theophylline. She continued to receive Coumadin for her chronic atrial fibrillation. Her heart rate was controlled and was maintained in the 60s-70s. On the third day of admission she developed worsening respiratory failure with fatigue, and hence was required to be intubated and ventilated. She was put on mechanical ventilation from 1/29 to 2/6/06. She was extubated on 2/6 and put on BI-PAP. The pressures were gradually increased from 10 and 5 to 15 of BI-PAP and 5 of E-PAP with FIO2 of 35% at the time of transfer to Kindred.

End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.

"Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"EPIDIDYMECTOMY,OPERATIVE NOTE:  ,The patient was placed in the supine position and prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A transverse scrotal incision was made and carried down to the tunica vaginalis, which was opened.  A small amount of clear fluid was expressed.  The tunica vaginalis was opened and the testicle was brought out through this incision.  The epididymis was separated off the surface of the testicle using a scalpel.  With blunt and sharp dissection, the epididymis was dissected off the testicle.  Bovie was used for hemostasis.  The vessels going to the testicle were preserved without any obvious injury, and a nice viable testicle was present after the epididymis was removed from this.  The blood supply to the epididymis was cauterized using a Bovie and the vas was divided with cautery also.  There was no obvious bleeding.  The cord was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, as was the dartos tissue in the scrotum.  The testicle was replaced in the scrotum.

"EXAM:  ,Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy.,HISTORY: , 30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder.  The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.

The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.

"FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cardiac arrest.,2.  Severe congestive heart failure.,3.  Acute on chronic respiratory failure.,4.  Osteoporosis.,5.  Depression.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This 92-year-old lady with history of depression and chronic low back pain, osteoporosis, and congestive heart failure, was diagnosed having pneumonia approximately for at least 10 days prior to admission.  In the ER, she was given oral antibiotics.  She also saw me few days before admission coming for a followup.  She was doing fairly well.  She was thought to have congestive heart failure and she was advised to continue with her diuretics.  For the last few days, the patient started to have anorexia, she did not eat well, and she did not drink well.  Her family could not take care of her.  So, she was brought to the emergency room, where she was found to have rapid heart rate with a sinus tachycardia around 112 to 130s.  The ________ was found to be dry.  She was given 1 L of IV fluids and she was subsequently admitted in the hospital for further management.,COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL: , The patient stayed in the telemetry.  The patient had significant shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure with bilateral basilar crackles.  She was continued on IV antibiotics and general IV hydration was started initially because of low blood pressure and low perfusion status.  On subsequently improved and stopped and Lasix was started; Dr. X, cardiologist was also placed.  The patient's family wanted her to be a DNR and DNI.  They were allowing us to treat her aggressively medically for pneumonia and congestive heart failure.  However, the patient became extremely weak, mostly unresponsive.  At this time, the patient's family wanted a Hospice consult, which was requested.  By the time the Hospice could evaluate her, the patient's condition got deteriorated, she went into more bradycardiac and hypertension and subsequently expired.

Abrasion/contusion, posterior right shoulder.,V. Abrasions of left lower back and posterior left lower leg.,VI. Abrasion and vancular congestion of vaginal mucosa.,VII. Ligature of right wrist.,TOXICOLOGIC STUDIES ,Blood ethanol - none detected.,Blood drug screen - no drugs detected.,CLINOCOPATHOLIGICAL CORRELATION:, Cause of death of this six year old female is asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma. ,The body of this six year old female was first seen by me after I was called to an address XYZ, on 12/26/96. I arrived at the scene approximately 8 PM on 12/26 and entered the house where the decedent's body was located at approximately 8:20 PM. ,A brief examination of the body disclosed a ligature around the neck and a ligature around the right wrist. Also noted was a small area of abrasion or contusion below the right ear on the lateral aspect of the right cheek. A prominent dried abrasion was present on the lower left neck. After examining the body, I left the residence at approximately 8:30 PM. ,EXTERNAL EVIDENCE OF INJURY:, Located just below the right ear at the right angle of the mandible, 1.5 inches below the right external auditory canal is a 3/8 x 1/4 inch area of rust colored abrasion. In the lateral aspect of the left lower eyelid on the inner conjunctival surface is a 1 mm in maximum dimension petechial hemorrhage. Very fine, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin of the upper eyelids bilaterally as well as on the lateral left cheek. On everything the left upper eyelid there are much smaller, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages located on the conjunctival surface. Possible petechial hemorrhages are also seen on the conjunctival surfaces of the right upper and lower eyelids, but liver mortis on this side of the face makes definite identification difficult. ,A deep ligature furrow encircles the entire neck. The width of the furrow varies from one- eight of an inch to five/sixteenths of an inch and is horizontal in orientation, with little upward deviation. The skin of the anterior neck above and below the ligature furrow contains areas of petechial hemorrhage and abrasion encompassing an area measuring approximately 3 x 2 inches. The ligature furrow crosses the anterior midline of the neck just below the laryngeal prominence, approximately at the level of the cricoid cartilage. It is almost completely horizontal with slight upward deviation from the horizontal towards the back of the neck. The midline of the furrow mark on the anterior neck is 8 inches below the top of the head. The midline of the furrow mark on the posterior neck is 6.75 inches below the top of the head. ,The area of abrasion and petechial hemorrhage of the skin of the anterior neck includes on the lower left neck, just to the left of the midline, a roughly triangular, parchment-like rust colored abrasion which measures 1.5 inches in length with a maximum width of 0.75 inches. This roughly triangular shaped abrasion is obliquely oriented with the apex superior and lateral. The remainder of the abrasions and petechial hemorrhages of the skin above and below the anterior projection of the ligature furrow are nonpatterned, purple to rust colored, and present in the midline, right, and left areas of the anterior neck. The skin just above the ligature furrow along the right side of the neck contains petechial hemorrhage composed of multiple confluent very small petechial hemorrhages as well as several larger petechial hemorrhages measuring up to one-sixteenth and one-eight of an inch in maximum dimension. Similar smaller petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin below the ligature furrow on the left lateral aspect of the neck. Located on the right side of the chin is a three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch area of superficial abrasion. On the posterior aspect of the right shoulder is a poorly demarcated, very superficial focus of abrasion/contusion which is pale purple in color and measures up to three-quarters by one-half inch in maximum dimension. Several linear aggregates of petechial hemorrhages are present in the anterior left shoulder just above deltopectoral groove. These measure up to one inch in length by one-sixteenth to one-eight of an inch in width. On the left lateral aspect of the lower back, approximately sixteen and one-quarter inches and seventeen and one-half inches below the level of the top of the head are two dried rust colored to slightly purple abrasions. The more superior of the two measures one-eight by one-sixteenth of an inch and the more inferior measures three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch. There is no surrounding contusion identified. On the posterior aspect of the left lower leg, almost in the midline, approximately 4 inches above the level of the heel are two small scratch-like abrasions which are dried and rust colored. They measure one-sixteenth by less than one- sixteenth of an inch and one-eight by less than one-sixteenth of an inch respectively. ,On the anterior aspect of the perineum, along the edges of closure of the labia majora, is a small amount of dried blood. A similar small amount of dried and semifluid blood is present on the skin of the fourchette and in the vestibule. Inside the vestibule of the vagina and along the distal vaginal wall is reddish hyperemia. This hyperemia is circumferential and perhaps more noticeable on the right side and posteriorly. The hyperemia also appears to extend just inside the vaginal orifice. A 1 cm red-purple area of abrasion is located on the right posterolateral area of the 1 x 1 cm hymeneal orifice. The hymen itself is represented by a rim of mucosal tissue extending clockwise between the 2 and 10:00 positions. The area of abrasion is present at approximately the 7:00 position and appears to involve the hymen and distal right lateral vaginal wall and possibly the area anterior to the hymen. On the right labia majora is a very faint area of violent discoloration measuring approximately one inch by three-eighths of an inch. Incision into the underlying subcutaneous tissue discloses no hemorrhage. A minimal amount of semiliquid thin watery red fluid is present in the vaginal vault. No recent or remote anal or other perineal trauma is identified. ,REMAINDER OF EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:, The unembalmed, well developed and well nourished Caucasian female body measures 47 inches in length and weighs an estimated 45 pounds. ,No scalp trauma is identified.

"HISTORY OF INJURY AND PRESENT COMPLAINTS: , The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman.  He is complaining chiefly of persistent lower back pain.  He states the pain is of a rather constant nature.  He describes it as a rather constant dull ache, sometimes rather sharp and stabbing in nature, most localized to the right side of his back more so than the left side of his lower back.  He states he has difficulty with prolonged standing or sitting.  He can only stand for about 5-10 minutes, then he has to sit down.  He can only sit for about 15-20 minutes, he has to get up and move about because it exacerbates his back pain.  He has difficulty with bending and stooping maneuvers.  He describes an intermittent radiating pain down his right leg, down from the right gluteal hip area to the back of the thigh to the calf and the foot.  He gets numbness along the lateral aspect of the foot itself.  He also describes chronic pain complaints with associated tension in the back of his neck.  He states the pain is of a constant nature in his neck.  He states he gets pain that radiates into the right shoulder girdle area and the right forearm.  He describes some numbness along the lateral aspect of the right forearm.  He states he has trouble trying to use his arm at or above shoulder height.  He has difficulty pushing, pulling, gripping, and grasping with the right upper extremity.  He describes pain at the anterior aspect of his shoulder, in particular.  He denies any headache complaints.  He is relating his above complaints to two industrial injuries that he sustained while employed with Frito Lay Company as a truck driver or delivery person.  He relates an initial injury that occurred on 06/29/1994, when apparently he was stepping out of the cab of his truck.  He lost his footing and fell.  He reached out to grab the hand railing.  He fell backwards on his back and his right shoulder.  He had immediate onset of shoulder pain, neck pain, and low back pain.  He had pain into his right leg.  He initially came under the care of Dr. H, an occupational physician in Modesto.  Initially, he did not obtain any MRIs or x-rays.  He did undergo some physical therapy and received some medications.  Dr. H referred him to Dr. Q, a chiropractor for three visits, which the patient was not certain was very helpful.  The patient advises he then changed treating physicians to Dr. N, D.C., whom he had seen previously for some back pain complaints back in 1990.  He felt that the chiropractic care was helping his back, neck, and shoulder pain complaints somewhat.  He continues with rather persistent pain in his right shoulder.  He underwent an MRI of the right shoulder performed on 08/16/1994 which revealed prominent impingement with biceps tenosynovitis as well as supraspinatus tendonitis superimposed by a small pinhole tear of the rotator cuff.  The patient was referred to Dr. P, an orthopedic surgeon who suggested some physical therapy for him and some antiinflammatories.  He felt that the patient might require a cortisone injection or possibly a surgical intervention.  The patient also underwent an MRI of the cervical spine on 08/03/1994, which again revealed multilevel degenerative disc disease in his neck.  There is some suggestion of bilateral neuroforaminal encroachment due to degenerative changes and disc bulges, particularly at C5-6 and C6-7 levels.  The patient was also seen by Dr. P, a neurologist for a Neurology consult.  It is unclear to me as to whether or not Dr. P had performed an EMG or nerve conduction studies of his upper or lower extremities.  The patient was off work for approximately six months following his initial injury date that occurred on 06/29/1994.  He returned back to regular duty.  Dr. N declared him permanent and stationary on 04/04/1995.  The patient then had a recurrence or flare-up or possibly new injury, again, particularly to his lower back while working for Frito Lay on 03/29/1997, when he was loading some pallets on the back of a trailer.  At that time, he returned to see Dr. N for chiropractic care, who is his primary treating physician.  Dr. N took him off work again.  He was off work again for approximately another six months, during which time, he was seen by Dr. M, M.D., a neurosurgeon.  He had a new MRI of his lumbar spine performed.  The MRI was performed on 05/20/1997.  It revealed L4-5 disc space narrowing with prominent disc bulge with some mild spinal stenosis.  The radiologist had noted he had a prior disc herniation at this level with some improvement from prior exam.  Dr. M saw him on 09/18/1997 and noted that there was some improvement in his disc herniation at the L4-5 level following a more recent MRI exam of 05/20/1997, from previous MRI exam of 1996 which revealed a rather prominent right-sided L4-5 disc herniation.  Dr. M felt that there was no indication for a lumbar spine surgery, but he mentioned with regards to his cervical spine, he felt that EMG studies of the right upper extremity should be obtained and he may require a repeat MRI of the cervical spine, if the study was positive.  The patient did undergo some nerve conduction studies of his lower extremities with Dr. K, M.D., which suggested a possible abnormal EMG with evidence of possible L5 radiculopathy, both right and left.  Unfortunately, I had no medical reports from Dr. P suggesting that he may have performed nerve conduction studies or EMGs of the upper and lower extremities.  The patient did see Dr. R for a neurosurgical consult.  Dr. R evaluated both his neck and lower back pain complaints on several occasions.  Dr. R suggested that the patient try some cervical epidural steroid injections and lumbar selective nerve root blocks.  The patient underwent these injections with Dr. K.  The patient reported only very slight relief temporarily with regards to his back and leg symptoms following the injections.  It is not clear from the medical record review whether the patient ever had a cervical epidural steroid injection; it appears that he had some selective nerve root blocks performed in the lumbar spine.  Dr. R on 12/15/2004 suggested that the patient had an MRI of the cervical spine revealing a right-sided C5-6 herniated nucleus pulposus which would explain his C-6 distribution numbness.  The patient also was noted to have a C4-5 with rather severe degenerative disc disease.  He felt the patient might be a candidate for a two-level ACDF at C4-5 and C5-6.  Dr. R in another report of 08/11/2004 suggested that the patient's MRI of 05/25/2004 of the lumbar spine reveals multilevel degenerative disc disease.  He had an L4-5 slight anterior spondylolisthesis, this may be a transitional vertebrae at the L6 level as well, with lumbarization of S1.  He felt that his examination suggested a possible right S1 radiculopathy with discogenic back pain.  He would suggest right-sided S1 selective nerve root blocks to see if this would be helpful; if not, he might be a candidate for a lumbar spine fusion, possibly a Dynesys or a fusion or some major spine surgery to help resolve his situation., ,The patient relates that he really prefers a more conservative approach of treatment regarding his neck, back, and right shoulder symptoms.  He continued to elect chiropractic care which he has found helpful, but apparently the insurance carrier is no longer authorizing chiropractic care for him.  He is currently taking no medications to manage his pain complaints.  He states regarding his work status, he was off work again for another six months following the 03/29/1997 injury.  He returned back to work and continued to work regular duty up until about a year ago, at which time, he was taken back off work again and placed on TTD status by Dr. N, his primary treating physician.  The patient states he has not been back to work since.  He has since applied for social security disability and now is receiving social security disability benefits.  The patient states he has tried some Myox therapy with Dr. H on 10 sessions, which he found somewhat helpful.  Overall, the patient does not feel that he could return back to his usual and customary work capacity as a delivery driver for Frito Lay.,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 23-year-old married man who had an onset of aplastic anemia in December, underwent a bone marrow transplant in the end of March, has developed very severe graft-versus-host reaction.  Psychiatric consultation has been requested as the patient has been noncompliant with treatment, leave the unit, does not return when requested, and it was unclear as to whether this is secondary to confusion or willful behavior.,The patient gives a significant history of behavioral problems from late adolescence until the onset of illness, states he had lot of trouble with law, he was convicted of assault, he was also arrested with small amount of cannabis, states he served one year incarcerated in ABCD that was about two years ago.  Gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  Prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  He would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available.,The patient is currently on Lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  He complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  He would have a limited support system here in Colorado.  He married in January and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in July.  I would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here.,The patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.  The patient's comment is that he grew up all over, that his parents had separated, that he lived with his mother, that he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, at that time was living in XYZ area because he did not like school.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL: , This is a cooperative man, speech is soft and difficult to understand.  There is no thought disorder and no hallucination.

This patient appears to retain the ability to make decisions on his own behalf.  I think he is mentally competent.  Unfortunately, his impulsive low frustration personality dynamics do not fit well with the demands and requirements for treatment of this chronic illness.  If the patient refuses treatment, he understands that the consequences of this would likely be hastened mortality and he does state that he does not want to die.,2.  The patient does complain of depressed mood, also of anxiety.  We did discuss medications.  He appeared somewhat sedated at the time of my interview.  I would recommend that we try Seroquel 25 mg twice daily on an as-needed basis to see if this diminishes anxiety.  I will have Dr. X followup with him.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.,My overall recommendation would be that the patient be on some random urine drug screening, that he use cell phone if he goes off the unit, to be called back up when treatments are scheduled, and hopefully he will be agreeable to complying with this.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia.  He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009.  He had double vision.  He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated.  The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.  He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system.  Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department.  He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side.  MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.  There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.  I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies any previous past medical history.  He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is uninsured.,MEDICATIONS:,  He does not take any medications.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his wife.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.

There is a nodule in her lung, which was treated by excision in February of 2007 on the right side.  She had spread to her kidney.  She had right-sided nephrectomy and left-sided nephrostomy.  She also had invasion of the bladder.  Currently, all of her urine comes out through the renal nephrostomy.  She complains of burning vaginal pain, as well as chronic discharge, which has improved slightly recently.  She is not able to engage in intercourse because of the pain and bleeding.  She also has pain with bowel movements, as well as painful urgency.  The pain is at least 3-4/10 and is partially relieved with methadone rescues and interferes with her ability to sleep at night as she feels exhausted and tired.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.  Felodipine 10 mg once a day.,5.  Klor-Con 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.,6.  Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily presumably for GERD.,7.  MiraLax 17 g p.o. daily.,8.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN.  IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

His creatinine has ranged between 4 and 4.5 over the past 6 months, since I have been following him.  I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes.  On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control.  He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.  He also needs followup for his elevated PSA in the past, which has not been done for over 2 years and will likely need cardiac clearance if we ever are able to evaluate him for transplant.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Really negative.  He continues to feel well.  He denies any problems with shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in his legs, nausea or vomiting, and his appetite remains good.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is well known to me for a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss from colitis.  We corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (IV) iron.  Ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.,I am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.,She had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.,She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs today showed a white blood count of 7.9, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets 1,121,000.  MCV is 89.  Her platelets have been elevated for at least the past week, with counts initially at the 600,000 to 700,000 range and in the last couple of day rising above 1,000,000.  Her hematocrit has been essentially stable for the past month or so.  White blood count has improved.,PT has been markedly elevated and today is 44.9 with an INR of 5.0.  This is despite stopping Coumadin on 05/31/2007, and with administration of vitamin K via the TPN, as well as additional doses IV.

ALT is 100, AST 57, GGT 226, alkaline phosphatase 505, albumin low at 3.3, uric acid high at 4.9, bilirubin normal, LDH normal, and pre-albumin low at 16.  Creatinine is at 1.5, with an estimated creatinine clearance low at 41.7.  Other electrolytes are fairly normal.,B12 was assessed on 05/19/2007 and was normal at 941.  Folic acid was normal.  Iron saturation has not been checked since March, and was normal then.  Ferritin has not been checked in a couple of months.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Erythropoietin 45,000 units every week, started 05/16/2007.  She is on heparin flushes, loperamide, niacin, pantoprazole, Diovan, Afrin nasal spray, caspofungin, daptomycin, Ertapenem, fentanyl or morphine p.r.n. pain, and Compazine or Zofran p.r.n. nausea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,GENERAL:  She is alert, and frustrated with her prolonged hospital stay.

I will check mixing studies to see if she has deficiency, which could be due to poor production given her elevated LFTs, decreased albumin, and decreased pre-albumin.,It is possible that she has an inhibitor, which would have to be an acquired inhibitor, generally presenting with an elevated PTT and not PT.  I will check a PTT and check mixing studies if that is prolonged.  It is doubtful that she has a lupus anticoagulant since she has been presenting with bleeding symptoms rather than clotting.  I agree with continuing off of anticoagulation for now.,She has markedly elevated platelet count.  I suspect this is likely reactive to infection, and not from a new myeloproliferative disorder.,Anemia has been stable, and is multifactorial.  Given her decreased creatinine clearance, I agree with erythropoietin support.  She was iron deficient last year, and with her multiple surgeries and poor p.o. intake, may have become iron deficient again.  She has had part of her small bowel removed, so there may be a component of poor absorption as well.  If she is iron deficient, this may contribute also to her elevated platelet counts.  I will check a ferritin.  This may be difficult to interpret because of inflammation.  If it is decreased, plan will be to add iron supplementation intravenously.  If it is elevated, we could consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate her iron stores, and also assess her myelopoiesis given the markedly elevated platelet counts.,She needs continued treatment as you are for her infections.,I will discuss the case with Dr. X as well since there is a question as to whether she might need additional surgery.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 41-year-old registered nurse (R.N.).  She was admitted following an overdose of citalopram and warfarin.  The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.,PSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.  Speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is no thought disorder.  She denies being suicidal.  Her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.

She appeared to have normal orientation, concentration, memory, and judgment.,Medical history is notable for factor V Leiden deficiency, history of pulmonary embolus, restless legs syndrome.  She has been off her Mirapex.  I did encourage her to go back on the Mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep.,The patient at this time can contract for safety.

Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

He is now 77 years old. He is being seen on the Seventh Floor. The patient is in Room 7607. The patient has a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable, since it engulfed the porta hepatis. The workup began with GI bleeding. He was seen in my office on 01/11/06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. A nonocclusive DVT was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. Both legs were edematous, and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present. An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a Greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. Additional information on the echocardiogram, where a grossly dilated left atrium, moderately severely dilated right atrium. The rhythm was, as stated before, atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. There was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic insufficiency. The ejection fraction was considered low normal, since it was estimated 50 to 54%. The patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia. The leg edema improved while lying down, suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. The patient, who was diabetic, received consultation by Dr. R. He was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ACE inhibitors. The atrial fibrillation was slow, and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time. As a matter of fact, they were discontinued.

He is an elderly gentleman who is currently without diaphoresis, pallor, jaundice, plethora, or icterus.,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 159/69 with a respiratory rate of 20, pulse is 67 and irregularly irregular. Pulse oximetry is 100.,NECK: Without JVD, bruit, or thyromegaly. The neck is supple.,CHEST: Symmetric. There is no heave or retraction.,HEART: The heart sounds are irregular and no significant murmurs could be auscultated.,LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.,ABDOMEN: Exam was deferred.,LEGS: Without edema. Pulses: Dorsalis pedis pulse was palpated bilaterally.,MEDICATIONS:, Current medications include enalapril, low dose enoxaparin, Fentanyl patches. He is no longer on fluconazole. He is on a sliding scale as per Dr. Holden. He is on lansoprazole (Prevacid), Toradol, piperacillin/tazobactam, hydralazine p.r.n., Zofran, Dilaudid, Benadryl, and Lopressor p.r.n.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:, The patient is a very pleasant elderly gentleman with intractable/inoperable malignancy. His cardiac issues are chronic and most likely secondary to long term hypertension and diabetes. He has chronic atrial fibrillation. I do not envision a scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control. He is also not a candidate for anticoagulation, which is, in essence, a part and parcel of the weight control. Reason being is high likelihood for GI bleeding, especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organs and lymph nodes. At this point, I agree with the notion of hospice care. If his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive, occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem or beta blockers would be appropriate; otherwise, I would keep him off those medications due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blockers.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"HISTORY: , A is a young lady, who came here with a diagnosis of seizure disorder and history of Henoch-Schonlein purpura with persistent proteinuria.  A was worked up for collagen vascular diseases and is here to find out the results.  Also was recommended to take 7.5 mg of Mobic every day for her joint pains.  She states that she continues with some joint pain and feeling tired all the time.  Mother states that also her seizure has continued without any control so far.  She is having some studies in the next few days.  She is mostly stiff on her legs, neck, and also on her hands.  The rest of the review of systems is in the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature today is 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, weight is 45.9 kg, blood pressure is 123/59, height is 149.5 cm, and pulse is 94.,HEENT:  She has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia, no oral ulcerations.  Pupils are reactive to accommodation.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limits.,NECK:  No neck masses.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,HEART:  Regular rhythm with no murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender with no visceromegaly.,SKIN:  No rashes today.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination shows good range of motion with no swelling or tenderness in any of her joints of the upper extremities, but she does have minus/plus swelling of her knees with flexion contracture bilaterally on both.,LABORATORY DATA: , Laboratories were not done recently, but we have some lab results from the previous evaluation that basically is negative for any collagen vascular disease, but shows some evidence of decreased calcium and vitamin D levels.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a patient, who today presents with symptoms consistent with possible oligoarticular arthritis of her knees with also arthralgias and deficiency in vitamin D.  She also has chronic proteinuria and seizure disorder.  My recommendation is to start her on vitamin D and calcium supplements, and also increase the Mobic to 50 mg, which is one of the few things she can tolerate with all the medication she is taking.  We are going to refer her to physical therapy and see her back in 2 months for followup.

"HISTORY: , The patient is a 4-month-old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with a peak gradient of 29 mmHg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16%.  A bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a percutaneous technique a 4-French 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place.  There was good blood return from both the ports.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ,ascending aorta and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The transverse arch measured 5 mm.  Isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level.  The diaphragm measured 5.6 mm.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery.  This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist.  Pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmHg gradient.  Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing.  The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist.  The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia.  There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt.  Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch.,Phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated flows were mildly increased.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels.  There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.  Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde.  Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg.  There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus.  There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries.  The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.,2.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.,3.  Bicuspid aortic valve.,4.  Patent foramen ovale.,INTERVENTION: , Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta.,MANAGEMENT: , The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference.  The patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery.  The patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4-6 months.  The further cardiologic care will be directed by Dr. X.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"HISTORY: , The patient is a 52-year-old right-handed female with longstanding bilateral arm pain, which is predominantly in the medial aspect of her arms and hands as well as left hand numbness, worse at night and after doing repetitive work with her left hand.  She denies any weakness.  No significant neck pain, change in bowel or bladder symptoms, change in gait, or similar symptoms in the past.  She is on Lyrica for the pain, which has been somewhat successful.,Examination reveals positive Phalen's test on the left.  Remainder of her neurological examination is normal.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:  ,The left median motor distal latency is prolonged with normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity.  The left median sensory distal latency is prolonged with an attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The right median sensory distal latency is mildly prolonged with a mildly attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The right median motor distal latency and evoked response amplitude is normal.  Left ulnar motor and sensory and left radial sensory responses are normal.  Left median F-wave is normal.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed on the left arm, right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles.  It revealed spontaneous activity in the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle.  There is increased insertional activity in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle.  Both interosseous muscles showed signs of reinnervation.  Left extensor digitorum communis muscle showed evidence of reduced recruitment.  Cervical paraspinal muscles were normal.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:  A left median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.  Electrical abnormalities are moderate-to-mild bilateral C8 radiculopathies.  This may be an incidental finding.,I have recommended MRI of the spine without contrast and report will be sent to Dr. XYZ.

"HISTORY:,  I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Seasonal allergies, possible food allergies, chronic sinusitis, hypertension and history of weight change.  She is currently 180 pounds.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Lower extremity vein stripping, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease and alcoholism.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , DynaCirc.,ALLERGIES: , Egg-based products cause hives.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient used to smoke cigarettes for about 20 years, one-half pack a day.  She currently does not, which was encouraged to continue.  She rarely drinks any alcohol-containing beverages.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 50, blood pressure is 136/74, pulse 84, temperature is 98.4, weight is 180 pounds, and height is 5 feet 3 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.  No nystagmus.,EARS:  During Hallpike examination, the patient did not become dizzy until she would be placed back into sitting in the upright position.  No nystagmus was appreciated; however, the patient did subjectively report dizziness, which was repeated twice.  No evidence of any orthostatic hypotension was noted during the exam.  Tympanic membranes were noted to be intact.  No signs of middle ear effusion or ear canal inflammation.,NOSE:  The patient appears congested.  Turbinate hypertrophy is noted.  There are no signs of any acute sinusitis.  Septum is midline, slightly deviated to the left.,THROAT:  There is clear postnasal drip.  Oral hygiene is good.  No masses or lesions noted.

The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,PROCEDURE: , Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy identifying turbinate hypertrophy and nasal septum deviation to the left, more significant posteriorly.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Probable increasing problems with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, both contributing to the patient's symptoms.,2.  Subjective dizziness, etiology uncertain; however, consider positional vertigo versus vestibular neuronitis as possible ear causes of dizziness, cannot rule out systemic, central or medication or causes at this time.,3.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.,4.  Nasal septum deformity.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  An ENG was ordered to evaluate vestibular function.  She was placed on Veramyst nasal spray two sprays each nostril daily and even twice daily if symptoms are worsening.  A Medrol Dosepak was prescribed as directed.  The patient was given instruction on use of nasal saline irrigation to be used twice daily and Clarinex 5 mg daily was recommended.  After the patients' ENG examination, we will see the patient back for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  In light of the patient's atypical dizziness symptoms, I cannot rule out other pathology at this time, and I informed her if there are any acute changes or problems with regards to her balance or any other acute changes, which she attributes associated with her dizziness, she most likely should pursue an emergent visit to the emergency room.,Thank you for allowing me to participate with the care of your patient.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"HISTORY:,  Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath.  Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.  Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours.,GENERAL:  This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough.  Pallor is improved.,EYES:  Conjunctivae are now pink.,ENT:  Oropharynx is clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Reveals distant heart tones with regular rate and rhythm.,LUNGS:  Have coarse breath sounds with wheezes, rhonchi, and soft crackles in the bases.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly appreciated.,EXTREMITIES:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips.,NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000.  This is up from 8.6 and 24.7.  Platelets are stable.  Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive.  EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.,IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.

"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 51-year-old female that was seen in consultation at the request of Dr. X on 06/04/2008 regarding chronic nasal congestion, difficulty with swallowing, and hearing loss.  The patient reports that she has been having history of recurrent sinus infection, averages about three times per year.  During the time that she gets the sinus infections, she has nasal congestion, nasal drainage, and also generally develops an ear infection as well.  The patient does note that she has been having hearing loss.  This is particular prominent in the right ear now for the past three to four years.  She does note popping after blowing the nose.  Occasionally, the hearing will improve and then it plugs back up again.  She seems to be plugged within the nasal passage, more on the right side than the left and this seems to be year round issue with her.

"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves.  Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago.  This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time.  She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms.  She is almost asymptomatic at present.

Bilateral H-reflexes are absent.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle.  Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment.,IMPRESSION:  ,This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy.,2.  Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies.  Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil.  I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return.  With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes.  However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following:  Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

"HISTORY:,  The patient was in the intensive care unit setting; he was intubated and sedated.  The patient is a 55-year-old patient, who was admitted secondary to a diagnosis of pancreatitis, developed hypotension and possible sepsis and respiratory as well as renal failure and found to be intubated.  He has been significantly hypotensive during his stay in the intensive care unit and has had minimal urine output.  His creatinine has gone from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight and the patient also developed florid acidosis and hypokalemia.  Nephrology input has been requested for management of acute renal failure and acidosis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Pancreatitis.,2.  Poison ivy.  The patient has recently been on oral steroids.,3.  Hypertension.,MEDICATIONS: , Include Ambien, prednisone, and blood pressure medication, which is not documented in the record at the moment.,INPATIENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Protonix IV, half-normal saline at 125 mL an hour, D5W with 3 ounces of bicarbonate at 150 mL an hour.  The patient was initially on dopamine, which has now been discontinued.  The patient remains on Levophed and Invanz 1 g IV q.24 h.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  Vitals, emergency room presentation, the blood pressure was 82/45.  His blood pressure in the ICU had dipped down into the 60s systolic, most recent blood pressure is 108/67 and he has been maintained on 100% FiO2.  The patient has had minimal urine output since admission.  HEENT, the patient is intubated at the moment.  Neck examination, no overt lymph node enlargement.  No jugular venous distention.  Lungs examination is benign in terms of crackles.  The patient has some harsh breath sounds secondary to being intubated.  CVS, S1 and S2 are fairly regular at the moment.  There is no pericardial rub.  Abdominal examination, obese, but benign.  Extremity examination reveals no lower extremity edema.  CNS, the patient is intubated and sedated.,LABORATORY DATA: , Blood work, sodium 152, potassium 2.7, bicarbonate 13, BUN 36, and creatinine 4.2.  The patient's BUN and creatinine yesterday were 23 and 2.1 respectively.  H&H of 17.7 and 51.6, white cell count of 8.4 from earlier on this morning.  The patient's liver function tests are all out of whack and his alkaline phosphatase is 226, ALT is 539, CK 1103, INR 1.66, and ammonia level of 55.  Latest ABGs show a pH of 7.04, bicarbonate of 10.7, pCO2 of 40.3, and pO2 of 120.7.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Acute renal failure, which in all probability is secondary to acute tubular necrosis and sepsis and significant hypotension, but the patient is at the moment on 100% FiO2.  He has been given intravenous fluid at a high rate to replete intravascular volume and to hopefully address his acidosis.  The patient also has significant acidosis and his creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight.  Given the fact that he would need dialytic support for his electrolyte derangements and for volume control, I would suggest continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration as opposed to conventional hemodialysis as the patient will not be able to tolerate conventional hemodialysis given his hemodynamic instability.,2.  Hypotension, which is significant and is related to his sepsis.  Now the patient has been maintained on Levophed and high rate of intravenous fluid at the moment.,3.  Acidosis, which is again secondary to his renal failure.  The patient was administered intravenous bicarbonate as mentioned above.  Dialytic support in the form of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was highly recommended for possible correction of his electrolyte derangements.,4.  Pancreatitis, which has been managed by his gastroenterologist.,5.  Sepsis, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.,6.  Hypercalcemia.  The patient has been given calcium chloride.  We will need to watch for rebound hypercalcemia.,7.  Hypoalbuminemia.,8.  Hypokalemia, which has been repleted.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , Again include continuation of IV fluid and bicarbonate infusion as well as transfer to the Piedmont Hospital for continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He also has a mildly raised brown lesion that the patient states has been there ever since he can remember and has not changed in size or caliber.  His testicles are descended bilaterally.  There are no masses.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is likely molluscum contagiosum (genital warts) caused by HPV.  I did state to the patient that this is likely a viral infection that could have had a long incubation period.  It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted.  He is instructed that he should use protected sex from this point on in order to try and limit the transmission.  Regarding the actual lesion itself, I did mention that we could apply a cream of Condylox, which could take up to a month to work.  I also offered him C02 laser therapy for the genital warts, which is an outpatient procedure.  The patient is very interested in something quick and effective such as a CO2 laser procedure.  I did state that the recurrence rate is significant and somewhere as high as 20% despite enucleating these lesions.  The patient understood this and still wished to proceed.

"IDENTIFYING DATA:  ,The patient is a 40-year-old white male.  He is married, on medical leave from his job as a tree cutter, and lives with his wife and five children.,CHIEF COMPLAINT AND REACTION TO HOSPITALIZATION:  ,The patient is admitted on a 72-hour involuntary treatment for dangerousness to others after repeated assaultive behaviors at Hospital Emergency Room, the morning prior to admission.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient was very sleepy this morning, only minimally cooperative with interview.  Additional information taken from the emergency room records that accompanied him from Hospital yesterday as well as from his wife, who I contacted by telephone.  The patient was apparently at his stable baseline when discharged from the Hospital on 01/21/10, status post back surgery following a work-related injury.  The patient returned to Emergency Room on the evening prior to admission complaining of severe back pain.  His ER course is notable for yelling, spitting, and striking multiple staff members.  The patient was originally to be admitted for pain control, but when he threatened to leave, he was referred to MHPs, who subsequently detained him for 72 hours for dangerousness to others.  On interview, the patient reports only hazy memories of these incidences and states this behavior was secondary to his pain and his medications.  He was contrite about the violence.  When his wife was contacted by telephone, she agreed with this assessment and reports that he has a history of domestic violence usually in the setting of alcohol and illicit substance intoxication, but denies any events in the last 3 years.,His wife reports that after discharge from the hospital, on 01/21/10, he was prescribed Percocet, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He essentially exhausted his approximately 10 days' supply of these agents on the morning of 01/23/10, and as above believes that this was responsible for his presentation yesterday.  She reports that she has been in contact with him since his arrival in our facility and reports that he is ""back to normal."" She denies feeling that he currently represents a threat to her or her five children.  She was unaware of his mental health history, but denies that he has received care for any condition since they were married three years ago.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient has a history of Involuntary Treatment Act of 72 hours in our facility in 2004 or 2005 for assaultive behaviors; however, these records are not currently available for review.  The patient denies any outpatient mental health treatment before or since this hospitalization.  He describes his mental health diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder; however, he denies a history of dramatic mood swings in the absence of illicit substances or alcohol intoxication.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Notable for status post back surgery, discharged from Hospital on 01/21/10.,MEDICATIONS:,  From discharge from Hospital on 01/21/10, include Percocet, Valium, Soma, and Vistaril, doses and frequency are not currently known.

The wife states that he has not consumed either since 12/07.  Of note, urine tox screen at Hospital was positive for marijuana.,LEGAL HISTORY:  ,The patient has been charged with domestic violence in the past, but his wife denies any repeat instances since in the last 3 years.  It is not known whether the patient is currently on probation.,GENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Unknown.,MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:,Attitude:  The patient is only minimally cooperative with interview secondary to being sleepy, and after repeated attempts to ask questions, he rolled over and went to bed.,Appearance: He is unkempt and there are multiple visible tattoos on his biceps.,Psychomotor:  There is no obvious psychomotor agitation or retardation.  There are no obvious extrapyramidal symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.,Affect:  His affect is notably restricted probably due to the fact that he is sleepy.,Mood:  Describes his mood as ""okay."",Speech:  Speech is normal rate, volume, and tone.,Thought Processes:  His thought processes appear to be linear.,Thought Content:  His thought content is notable for his expressions of contrition about violence at Hospital last night.  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.,Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person, place, and date but not situation.  Attributes this to not really remembering the events at Hospital that resulted in this hospitalization.,Judgment and Insight:  His insight and judgment are both appear to be improving.,Assets:  Include his supportive wife and the fact he has been able to remain alcohol and methamphetamine sobriety for the last 3 years.,Limitations:  Include his back injury and possible need for improvement of health treatment engagement.,FORMULATION:  ,This is a 40-year-old white male, who was admitted for an acute agitation in the setting of misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He appears much improved from his condition at Hospital last night and I suspect that his behavior is most likely attributed to delirium and this since resolved.  He reports historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, however, the details of this diagnosis are not currently available for review.,DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Delirium, resolved (recent mental status changes likely secondary to misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, Valium, and hydroxyzine.)  Rule out bipolar affective disorder.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  Chronic pain status post back surgery.,AXIS IV:  Appears to be moderate.  He is currently on medical leave from his job.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning is currently 50 (his GAF was 20 approximately 24 hours ago).,ESTIMATED LENGTH OF STAY:,  Three days.,PLAN:,  I will hold psychiatric medications for now given the patient's fairly rapid improvement as he cleared from the condition, I suspect is likely due to misuse of prescribed medications.  The patient will be placed on CIWA protocol given that one of the medications he overused was Valium.  Of note, he does not currently appear to be withdrawing and I anticipate that his CIWA will be discontinued prior to discharge.  I would like to increase the database regarding the details of his historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder before pursuing referrals for outpatient mental health care.  The internal medicine service will evaluate for treatment for any underlying medical problems specifically to provide recommendations regarding pain management.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"IDENTIFYING DATA:,  The patient is a 45-year-old white male.

The patient is admitted on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,On the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.,I was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient's longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient's dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient's partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was ""useful, but not dosed high enough."" Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  The patient is fairly vague on his history of AIDS related conditions, but does identify the following:  Thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections; additional details of these problems are not currently known.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his partner.  He is unemployed.  Details of his educational and occupational history are not currently known.  His source of finances is also unknown, though social security disability is presumed.,SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY: , The patient smoked one to two packs per day for most of the last year, but has increased this to two to three packs per day in the last month.

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia.  However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible.  Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours.  We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture.  If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.,As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH.  Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.,2.  Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above.  No immediate indication for anticoagulation.  If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy.  This was discussed with Dr. X.  Preference would be to run intravenous heparin with PTT of 45 during her thrombocytopenic nadir and initiation of full-dose anticoagulation once nadir is resolved.,3.  Congestive heart failure.

Both groins were draped and sterilized in the usual fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with 2% lidocaine to the right groin area and a #6-French femoral sheath was inserted via modified Seldinger technique in the right common femoral artery.  Selective coronary angiography was performed with #6 French JL4 catheter for the left coronary system and a #6 French JR4 catheter of the right coronary artery.  Left ventricular catheterization and angiography was performed at the end of the procedure with a #6-French angle pigtail catheter.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics systemic blood pressure 140/70 mmHg.  LVEDP at the end of the procedure was 13 mmHg.,2.  The left main coronary artery is a large with mild diffuse disease in the distal third resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the take off of the left circumflex artery.  The left circumflex artery is a large caliber vessel with diffuse disease in the ostium of the proximal segment resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis.  The left circumflex artery gives rise to a high small obtuse marginal branch that has high moderate-to-severe ostium.  The rest of the left circumflex artery has mild diffuse disease and it gives rise to a second large obtuse marginal branch that bifurcates into an upper and lower trunk.,The LAD is calcified and diffusely disease in the proximal and mid portion.  There is mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal LAD resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis.,3.  The right coronary artery is dominant.  It is septal to be occluded in the mid portion.,The findings were discussed with the patient and she opted for PCI.  Angiomax bolus was started.  The ACT was checked.  It was higher in 300.  I have given the patient 600 mg of oral Plavix.,The right coronary artery was engaged using a #6-French JR4 guide catheter.  I was unable to cross through this lesion using a BMW wire and a 3.0x8 mm balloon support.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using a whisper wire.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using Cross-IT 100 wire.  I have also used second #6-French Amplatz right I guide catheter.  At one time, I have lost flow in the distal vessel.  The patient experienced severe chest pain, ST-segment elevation, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids and atropine along with intravenous dopamine.,Dr. X was notified.,Eventually, an Asahi grand slam wire using the same 3.0 x 8 mm Voyager balloon support, I was able to cross into the distal vessel.  I have performed careful balloon angioplasty of the mid RCA.  I have given nitroglycerin under the nursing several times during the procedure.,I then performed arthrectomy using #5-French export catheter.,I performed more balloon predilation using a 3.0 x16 mm Voyager balloon.  I then deployed 4.0 x15 mm, excised, and across the mid RCA at 18 atmospheres with good angiographic result.  Proximal to the proximal edge of the stent, there was still some persistent haziness most likely just diseased artery/diffuse plaquing.  I decided to cover this segment using a second 4.0 x 15 mm, excised, and two stents were overlapped, the overlap was postdilated using the same stent delivery balloon at high pressure with excellent angiographic result.,Left ventricular catheterization was performed with #6-French angle pigtail catheter.  The left ventricle is rather smaller in size.  The mid inferior wall is minimally hypokinetic, ejection fraction is 70%.  There is no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation.,Femoral angiography revealed that the entry point was above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and I have performed this as Perclose hemostasis.,CONCLUSIONS,1.  Normal left ventricular size and function.  Ejection fraction is 65% to 70%.  No MR.,2.  Successful angioplasty and stenting of the subtotally closed mid RCA.  This was hard, organized thrombus, very difficult to penetrate.  I have deployed two overlapping 4.0 x15 mm excised and with excellent angiographic result.  The RCA is dominant.,3.

This catheter was exchanged for a left #4 Judkins catheter which was advanced to the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.,The patient was found to have the above mentioned high-grade lesion in the right coronary artery and a coronary intervention was performed.  A 6-French sheath and a right Judkins guide was placed.  The patient was started on bivalarudin.  A BMW wire was easily placed across the lesion and into the distal right coronary artery.  A 3.0 x 15 mm Voyager balloon was placed and deployed at 10 atmospheres.  The intermediate result was improved with TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the vessel.  Following this, a 3.0 x 18 mm Xience stent was placed across the lesion and deployed at 17 atmospheres.  This revealed excellent result however at the very distal of the stent there was an area of haziness but no definite dissection.  This was stented with a 3.0 x 8 mm Xience stent deployed again at 17 atmospheres.  Final angiograms revealed excellent result with TIMI-3 flow at the terminus of the right coronary artery and approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing.  The guiding catheter was withdrawn over wire and a pigtail was placed.  This was advanced to the abdominal aorta at the area of obstruction and small injection of contrast was given demonstrating that there was a small aneurysm versus a small retrograde dissection in that area with some dye hang up after injection.  The catheter was removed.  The bivalarudin was stopped at the termination of procedure.  A small injection of contrast given through arterial sheath and Angio-Seal was placed without incident.,It should also be noted that an 8-French sheath was placed in the right femoral vein.  This was placed initially as the patient was going to have a right heart catheterization as well because of the dyspnea.,Total contrast media, 205 mL, total fluoroscopy time was 7.5 minutes, X-ray dose, 2666 milligray.,HEMODYNAMICS: , Rhythm was sinus throughout the procedure.  Aortic pressure was 170/81 mmHg.,The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel.  This vessel gives rise to conus branch and two small RV free wall branches and PDA and a small left ventricular branch.  It should be noted that there was competitive flow in the posterior left ventricular branch and that the distal right coronary artery fills via left sided collaterals.  In the proximal right coronary artery, there is a large ulcerative plaque followed immediately by a severe stenosis that is subtotal in severity.  After intervention, there is TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the right coronary with better fill into the distal right coronary artery and loss of competitive flow.  There was approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst part of the previous stenosis.,The left main is without disease and trifurcates into a moderate-sized ramus intermedius, the LAD and the circumflex.  The ramus intermedius is free of disease.  The LAD terminates at the LV apex and has elongated area of mild stenosis at its mid segment.  This measures 25% to 30% at its worst point.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel.  There is a proximal 15% to 20% stenosis and an area of ectasia in the proximal circumflex.  Distally, this circumflex gives rise to a large bifurcating marginal artery and beyond that point, the circumflex is a small vessel within the AV groove.,The aortogram demonstrates eccentric aneurysm formation.  This may represent a small retrograde dissection as well.  There was some dye hang up in the wall.,IMPRESSION,1.  Successful stenting of subtotal stenosis of the proximal coronary artery.,2.  Non-obstructive coronary artery disease in the mid left anterior descending as described above and ectasia of the proximal circumflex coronary artery.,3.

"OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Full mouth dental rehabilitation in the operative room under general anesthesia.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe dental caries.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Severe dental caries.,2.  Non-restorable teeth.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,DURATION OF SURGERY: , 43 minutes.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient was first seen by me on 04/26/2007.  She had a history of open heart surgery at 11 months' of age.  She presented with severe anterior caries with most likely dental extractions needed.  Due to her young age, I felt that she would be best served in the safety of the hospital operating room.  After consultation with the mother, she agreed to have her treated in the safety of the hospital operating room at Children's Hospital.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION:  ,This child was brought to Hospital Day Surgery and is accompanied by her mother.  There I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restorations to be performed, the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all their questions and concerns were addressed, I gave the informed consent to proceed with the treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  Once she was cleared by Anesthesia and the child was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection.  An angiocatheter was placed in the left hand and an IV was started.  The head and neck were draped with sterile towels, and the body was covered with a lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond the tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative clinical photographs were taken.  Two posterior bitewing radiographs and two anterior periapical films were taken in the operating room with digital radiography.  After the radiographs were taken, the lead shield was removed.  Prophylaxis was then performed using prophy cup and fluoridated prophy paste.  The teeth were then rinsed well and the patient's oral cavity was suctioned clean.  Clinical and radiographic examinations followed and areas of decay were noted.  During the restorative phase, these areas of decay were entered into and removed.  Entry was made to the level of the dental-enamel junction and beyond as necessary to remove it.  Final caries was removed and was confirmed upon reaching hard, firm sounding dentin.  Teeth restored with amalgam had a dentin tubular seal placed prior to amalgam placement.  Non-restorable primary teeth would be extracted.,Upon conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were then taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction with visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.,At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS:  ,This young patient presented with mild generalized marginal gingivitis secondary to light generalized plaque accumulation and fair oral hygiene.  All primary teeth were present.  Dental caries were present on the following teeth:  Tooth D, E, F, and G caries on all surfaces; teeth J, lingual caries.  The remainder of her teeth and soft tissues were within normal limits.  The following restorations and procedures were performed:  Tooth D, E, F, and G were extracted and four sutures were placed one at each extraction site and tooth J lingual amalgam.,CONCLUSION:  ,The mother was informed of the completion of the procedure.

"OPERATION,1.  Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy.,2.  Feeding jejunostomy.,3.  Placement of two right-sided #28-French chest tubes.,4.  Right thoracotomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.,Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

"OPERATION,1.  Right upper lung lobectomy.,2.  Mediastinal lymph node dissection.,ANESTHESIA,1.  General endotracheal anesthesia with dual-lumen tube.,2.  Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

After adequate anesthesia via endotracheal intubation, the nose was prepped with Afrin nasal spray.  After this was done, 1% Xylocaine with 100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in both sides of the septum and the mucoperichondrium.  After this, the sinus endoscope at 25-degrees was then used to examine the nasal cavity in the left nasal cavity and staying lateral to the middle turbinate.  A 45-degree forceps then used to open up the maxillary sinus.  There was some prominent tissue and just superior to this, the anterior ethmoid was opened.  The 45-degree forceps was then used to open the maxillary sinus ostium.  This was enlarged with backbiting rongeur.  After this was done, the tissue found in the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were removed and sent to pathology and labeled as left maxillary sinus mucosa.  After this was done, attention was then turned to the right nasal cavity staying laterally to the middle turbinate.  There was noted to have prominence in the anterior ethmoidal area.  This was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  This mucosa was then removed from the anterior area.  The maxillary sinus ostium was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  Tissue was removed from this area.  This was sent as right maxillary mucosa.  After this, the backbiting rongeur was then used to open up the ostium and enlarge the ostium on the right maxillary sinus.  Protecting the eyes with wet gauze and using KTP laser at 10 watts, the sinus endoscope was used for observation and the submucosal resection was done of both inferior turbinates as well as anterior portion of the middle turbinates bilaterally.  This was to open up to expose the maxillary ostium as well as other sinus ostium to minimize swelling and obstruction.  After this was completed, a septoplasty was performed.  The incision was made with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The flap was then elevated, overlying the spur that was protruding into the right nasal cavity.  This was excised with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The tissue was then laid back in position.  After this was laid back in position, the nasal cavity was irrigated with saline solution, suctioned well as well as the oropharynx.  , ,Surgicel with antibiotic ointment was placed in each nostril and sutured outside the nose with 3-0 nylon.

"OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.  This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.  The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch.  Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied.  The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
"OTITIS MEDIA, is an infection of the middle ear space where the small bones and nerves of the ear connect to the eardrum on one side and the eustachian tube on the other.  The ear infection itself is not contagious but the respiratory infection preceding it is transmittable.  Otitis media is most often seen in infants and young children.  There are several causes including a viral or bacterial infection that spreads to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tubes, nasal allergy drainage blocking the sinuses or eustachian tubes, enlarged adenoids also blocking sinuses or eustachian tubes and eardrum rupture.  Many factors can increase the risk of an ear infection like recent upper respiratory tract illness, crowded living conditions, family history of ear infections, day care, smoking in household, altitude changes, cold weather and genetic factors.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Irritability.,*  Ear pain, fullness, hearing loss.,*  Infants may pull on ear.,*  Fever.,*  Vomiting.,*  Discharge from ear.,*  Diarrhea.,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis is by physical exam and otoscopic exam.

I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.

There was no adenoid specimen.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 9-year-old Caucasian male with history of recurrent episodes of adenotonsillitis that has been refractory to outpatient antibiotic therapy.  The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.

Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.,2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.

The patient is status post laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy BSO.  The patient was referred to me by Dr. X.  Because of the incomplete staging, the patient was advised to undergo a robotic-assisted surgical staging.  Risks, benefits, and rationale of these procedures were reviewed.  The patient has understanding of these risks and wishes to proceed with the surgery as planned.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS,1.  No evidence of ascites.,2.  At the time of the exploratory laparotomy, the diaphragm was well palpated.  They were clear.  The low attachments were removed.  The lesser omentum was unremarkable.  The pancreas, spleen, and liver were unremarkable.  The gallbladder was unremarkable.  The stomach appeared grossly normal.  The small bowel was inspected from the ligament which starts to the ileocecal valve.  There is no evidence of disease.  Paracolic gutter and peritoneum was free.  The omentum was grossly normal.,3.  In the pelvis, uterus, tubes, and ovaries were absent.  There was no evidence seeding along the bladder, pelvic, cul-de-sac, and peritoneum.,4.  Retroperitoneally, pelvic lymph nodes were mostly normal; however, at the right aortic, there are nodes.  These nodes were extremely fibrotic and they were densely adherent to the anterior wall of the vena cava which precluded me from performing a robotic periaortic lymph node dissection.  There was some area that was suspicious right at the low right periaortic lymph node.  They were sent for frozen section and they came back as benign.  It is unclear to me why did the lymph nodes were quite fibrotic and firm, but we will wait for the pathology report.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was given IV antibiotics prior to our incision site, sequential compression device was placed as part of the DVT prophylaxis.  I have requested an epidural catheter be placed for purpose of the periaortic lymph node dissection.  With this in mind, we proceeded as such.,We initially began with the robotic portion of the procedure.,A 1-cm supraumbilical incision made.  A Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Pneumoperitoneum was achieved to the abdominal pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12mm trocar was inserted without difficulty.  After completion of this, a 12mm trocar was placed in the left lower quadrant 2 fingerbreadths medial to the anterior superior iliac spine under direct laparoscopic visualization.  After completion of this, a laparoscope was then placed in the left lower quadrant port to assist in the placement of the remainder of the da Vinci ports.  Two 8-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant 8 cm apart while one 8-mm port was placed in the left upper quadrant 8 cm apart.  After completion of this, the patient was placed in steep Trendelenburg position.  The robotic system was then docked and after docking the robotic system, the instrumentation was inserted under direct laparoscopic visualization to ensure that there was no injury to the abdominal contents.  Once this was completed, the robotic camera was then docked.  We then proceeded with our daVinci portion of the procedure.,I then proceeded now with the omentectomy.  The omentum was taken off the transverse colon with the harmonic scalpel.  The entire omentum was removed and placed in the pelvis.  After completion of this, I then proceeded now with the pelvic lymph node dissection.,An incision was made parallel along the peritoneum overlying the psoas muscle.  All the lymph node bearing tissues along the external iliac artery and vein were subsequently skeletonized off the vessels and resected.  The lymph node bearing tissues interposed between the external iliac vein and psoas muscle were mobilized into the obturator fossa and subsequently removed off the accessory obturator vein, artery and nerve.  In the process of removing the lymphoid tissues, the genitofemoral nerve along with the accessory obturator vein, obturator artery and nerve were all preserved.  The lymphoid tissues interposed between the external iliac vein and psoas muscle along with the common iliac vessels were also subsequently removed.  The lymph node bearing tissues bifurcating at the hypogastric and the external iliac vein were likewise removed in addition to the hypogastric lymph nodes.  All the lymph node tissues were placed in an Endobag and removed and submitted as pelvic nodes on the right side and subsequently the left side.  Boundaries of the pelvic nodal dissection distally were the external circumflex iliac vein, laterally the psoas muscle along with the obturator internus fascia, medially the superior vesical artery along with the ureter, and inferiorly below the obturator nerve.,At this point in time, we have attempted the periaortic lymph node dissection.  I did open up the peritoneum overlying the bifurcation of the aorta.  This peritoneum was incised up to the level of the duodenal recess.  It was at this point in time that the periaortic lymph node dissection was extremely difficult.  I was unable to get a tissue plane as the lymph nodes were apparently very fibrotic.  I was concerned that I would tear off the anterior wall of the cava in the process of trying to perform the right periaortic lymph node.  For this reason, I aborted the robotic procedure or in after nearly attempting for about an hour and a half for the periaortic lymph nodes.  Once this was unsuccessful, the robotic system was then dedocked.  I then placed additional ports.  A 5-mm port was placed in the suprapubic region, two fingerbreadths above.  A right lower quadrant 12-mm port was placed.  After completion of this, I had attempted to see whether we could do the remainder of the periaortic lymph node dissection via laparoscopically.  Despite an attempt for a nearly 35 minutes, I was not able to get adequate exposure.  The small bowel kept on falling in the operative field which precluded us to perform the procedure safely.  For this reason, I converted to an open procedure.,A midline incision was made from suprapubic bone and extended above the umbilicus.  The abdominal cavity was entered without injuring the bell.  After entering the abdomen, omentum was removed.  Ray-Tec sponges were removed.  We covered for the Ray-Tec sponges.  After completion of this, Thompson retractor was placed.  The patient was placed in C-Trendelenburg position.  The bowel was packed cephalad.  Retroperitoneum space was entered right and left ureters were identified.  I then meticulously resected the lymphoid-bearing tissues anterior and lateral to the cava.  This dissection was quite difficult as the lymph nodes were extremely fibrotic and adherent to the caval wall.  I was able to freed up these lymph nodes without injuring of the cava.  Likewise, the left periaortic lymph node dissection was carried out from the level of the bifurcation to 1 cm above the IMA.  All the periaortic lymph node dissection was then carried out.  After completion of this, I then took washings.  Random biopsies were obtained of the cul-de-sac and right and left pelvic side wall along with the right and left paracolic gutter.  After completion of this, the patient appears to have tolerated the procedure well.  There was no obvious gross disease.  The bowel was inspected meticulously to ensure that there was no evidence of injury.  Once this was completed, the bowel was placed back to its normal position.  Several film solutions were placed.  We counted for sponges, needles, and instruments.  Once this was counted for, the fascia was then closed with #2 Vicryl suture in a mass closure fashion.  The subcutaneous route was copiously irrigated with water.  The JP drain was brought to the right lower quadrant incision.  All the incision ports were then closed with 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Likewise, the midline incision was closed with 3-0 Monocryl sutures.,At the conclusion of the procedure, there was no obvious gross disease left.,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

He also has persistent tonsillitis with hypertrophy and tonsillolith and halitosis.  He also has developed tremendous edema to his posterior palate and uvula, which is causing choking.  Correction of these mechanical abnormalities is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the right and left nasal septal mucosa and right and left inferior turbinates were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using approximately 10 mL.  Afrin-soaked pledgets were placed in the nasal cavity bilaterally.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hemitransfixion incision was performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage was incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone was removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur was removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum was reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinates were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.  Hemostasis was acquired by using suction electrocautery.  The turbinates were then covered with bacitracin ointment after cauterizing them and bacitracin ointment soaked Doyle splints were placed in the right and left nares and secured anteriorly to the columella with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was draped in a clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted and the McIvor was gently suspended from the Mayo stand.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using a Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in a similar fashion, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle, and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  The extremely edematous portion of soft palate was resected using a right angle clamp and right angle scissor and was closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight interrupted fashion.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

Removal of pigtail catheter.,3.  Limited exploratory laparotomy with removal of foreign body and lysis of adhesions.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Under general endotracheal anesthesia, first of all the patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus and the left gluteal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The opening of the abscess was probed and there was a tract of about 20 cm going subcutaneously upward.  I proceeded to enlarge the drainage area and to some degree unroofing the tract partially and then the area was débrided and then packed with iodoform gauze and a temporary dressing was applied.,Then, the patient was placed in a supine position, and I proceeded to remove the pigtail catheter after dividing it to undo its locking mechanism.  It came out without any difficulty.  Then, the colostomy was protected and draped apart, and the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  My initial idea was to just drain and debride the wound infection, which had a sinus tract at lower end of the midline incision.  I initially probed the wound with a hemostat and this had at least 12 cm long tract and I proceeded to excise the badly scarred skin that was on top of it and then continued the dissection to the fascia and I realized that the sinus tract was going through the fascia into the abdomen.  Very carefully, I started dividing the fascia.  Of course, there were several small bowel loops adhered to the area.  The dissection was quite tedious for a while.  Initially, I thought that may be there was an enterocutaneous fistula in the area, but then I realized that the tissue that was interpreted as an intestinal mucosa was actually a very smooth __________ tissue that was walling the sinus tract.  I made a laparotomy of about 10 cm and I carefully dissected the bowel of the fascia.  There was an area at the bottom which looked like a foreign body and initially I thought there was a mesh that can be used to close the abdomen, but later on this substance floated out by self and it was an elongated strip, maybe about 6 cm, which we sent to Pathology for examination.  Initially, I have obtained a sample for culture and sensitivity for aerobic and anaerobic organisms.,I was very happy that we were not really dealing with enterocutaneous fistula.  The area was irrigated generously with saline and then we closed the fascia with number of interrupted figure-of-eight sutures of heavy PPS.  The subcutaneous tissue and the skin were left open and packed with Betadine-soaked sponges.,A dressing was applied.  A small dressing was applied to the area where we removed the pigtail catheter and also we went down to the gluteal area and put a formal dressing in that area.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was minimal, and he was sent to the ICU and also made acute care because of the need for a laparotomy, which we were not anticipating.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In the preoperative area, the patient received pilocarpine drops.  The patient received IV propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were given.  The operative eye then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lids, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A screw type speculum was inserted to maintain patency of lids.  A 6-0 Vicryl suture was placed through the superior cornea, and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior conjunctiva.  A peritomy was performed approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus and this flap was dissected forward to the cornea.  All Tenons were removed from the overlying sclera and the area was treated with wet-field cautery to achieve hemostasis.  A 2 mm x 3 mm scleral flap was then outlined with a Micro-Sharp blade.  This was approximately one-half scleral depth in thickness.  A crescent blade was then used to dissect forward the clear cornea.  Hemostasis was again achieved with wet-field cautery.  A Weck-Cel sponge tip soaked in mitomycin was then placed under the conjunctival and tenon flap and left there for two minutes.  The site was then profusely irrigated with balanced salt solution.  A paracentesis wound was made temporarily and then the Micro-Sharp blade was used to enter the anterior chamber at the anterior most margin of the trabeculectomy bed.  A Kelly-Descemet punch was then inserted, and a trabeculectomy was performed.  Iris was withdrawn through the trabeculectomy site and a peripheral iridectomy was performed using Vannas scissors and 0.12 forceps.  The iris was then repositioned into the eye and the anterior chamber was inflated with BSS.  The scleral flap was sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures with knots trimmed, rotated, and buried.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture on a BV needle.  BSS was irrigated in the anterior chamber and the blood was noted to elevate nicely without leakage.  Antibiotic and steroid drops were placed in the eye as was homatropine 5%.  The antibiotic consisted of Vigamox and the steroid was Econopred Plus.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after the drape was removed.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.  She will be seen in followup in the office tomorrow.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues.  Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7.  Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen.  This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well.  This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed.  At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam.  Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7.  These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size.  The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc.  The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.,Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition.

The patient has undergone cleft lip repair, and she is here today for her cleft palate operation.  We have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure, risks, and benefits; the risks included but not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, the need for future revision surgeries.  We will proceed with surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position, and general anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given.  The patient proceeded to have bilateral PE tube placement by Dr. X, from Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery.  After he was done with his procedure, the head of the bed was turned 90 degrees.  The patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut.  A Dingman retractor was placed.  The operative area was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, a total of 3 mL, and then, I proceeded with the prepping and draping.  The patient was prepped and draped.  I proceeded to do the palate repair.  The nature of the palate repair was done in the same way on the both sides.  I will describe one side.  The other side was done exactly in the same manner.  The 2 hemiuvulas are placed, holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, triangle in the nasal mucosa was previously marked.  This triangle of nasal mucosa was removed and excised.  This was done on both uvulas.  Then, an incision was done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa.  A 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa was used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better.  Once the incision was done up to the level of the hard palate, the muscle was dissected off the surrounding tissue, 2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa.  Then, I proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15-blade.  The incision starts at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and comes anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap.  Then the flap was lifted up with the help of a freer, and then the remaining of the incision medially was completed.  Hemostasis was achieved with help of electrocautery and Surgicel.  The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator.  The greater auricular foramen was exposed, and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap.  Then an osteotomy was done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially as well as a small incision was done in the periosteum around the pedicle.  The pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially.  This procedure was done on both sides in the same manner, and then __________ dissection was done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa, it was evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together.  At this point, the decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps.  The flaps are __________ infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book.  The incision was done with a 15C blade.  The vomer flaps were dissected, and the mucosa was moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate.  This was approximated on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted stitches, and I proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 5-0 chromic and a 4-0 chromic.  Then 2 stitches of 4-0 Vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side, on the other side, and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edges of the soft palate.  The remaining part of the soft palate was placed together with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The throat pack was removed.  The palate was cleaned.  The Dingman retractor was removed, and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the tongue was applied with 2-0 silk to the dorsal aspect of the tongue and attached to the right cheek with a piece of Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  BSS is applied to the eye after removing the Tegaderm.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.

She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.,The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The left ear was then draped in a clean fashion.  Under microscopic visualization, the ear canal was cleaned of the wax.  Myringotomy incision was made in the anterior inferior quadrant.  There was no fluid in the middle ear space.  A Micron Bobbin tube was easily placed.  Floxin drops were placed in the ear.  The same was performed on the right side with similar findings.  The patient was then turned to be placed in Rose position.  The patient draped in clean fashion.  A small McIvor mouth gag was used to hold open the oral cavity.  The soft palate was palpated.  There was no submucous cleft felt.  Using a 1:1 mixture of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and 0.25% Marcaine, both tonsillar pillars and the fossae injected with approximately 7 mL total.  Using a curved Allis the right tonsil was grasped and pulled medially.  Tonsil was dissected off the tonsillar fossa using a Coblator.  The left tonsil was removed in the similar fashion.  Hemostasis then achieved in tonsillar fossa using the Coblator on coagulation setting.  The soft palate was then retracted using red rubber catheter.  Under mirror visualization, the patient was found to have enlarged adenoids.  The adenoids were removed using the Coblator.  Hemostasis was also achieved using the Coblator on coagulation setting.  The rubber catheter was then removed.  Reexamining the oropharynx, small bleeding points were cauterized with the Coblator.  Stomach contents were then aspirated with saline sump.

It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.

The patient was felt to be a candidate for decompression stabilization pulling distraction between the screws to relieve radicular pain.  The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak.  The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was intubated.  Foley catheter was in place.  The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped.  A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel.  The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala.  Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone.  The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting.  The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints.  Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed.  Pars interarticularis were maintained.  Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise.  Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side.  Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe.  It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body.  At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed.  Good bone purchase was obtained.  Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1.  Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots.

The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the pectoralis major muscle medially beneath the inferior third of the right clavicle was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  An incision transverse, parallel, and inferior to the middle third of the right clavicle was performed.  A subcutaneous pocket on the surface of the pectoralis major muscle was created.  The muscular fascia was also infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  With the patient in the Trendelenburg position, utilizing the provided introducer needle, the right subclavian vein was cannulated.  A guidewire was passed without difficulty and the needle was removed.  Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory position of the guidewire in the right atrium.  A dilator and sheath was passed over the guidewire.  The guidewire and dilator were removed and a provided catheter was inserted through the sheath and the sheath was carefully withdrawn.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position of the catheter and the catheter under fluoroscopic guidance was retracted into the superior vena cava.  The catheter had been preflushed with dilute heparin solution (100 units/mL).  The port, which had been preflushed with saline, was attached to the catheter at approximately 13 cm level.  The locking cap had been placed on the catheter.  The port was connected to the catheter and the locking cap was secured.  The port was again flushed with dilute heparin solution and placed within the subcutaneous pocket.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position.  A hard copy of the fluoroscopy was obtained.  The catheter and port were secured to the pectoralis fascia in four locations with 2-0 Prolene suture.  Site was irrigated with saline.  Hemostasis was verified.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The subcutaneous and dermis were closed with a running subcuticular 3-0 Vicryl suture.  A 0.25-inch Steri-Strips were applied.

Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors.  Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal.  The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture.  This was done twice.  The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision.  The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field.  The sac was then opened completely around the testis.  The appendix testis was cauterized.  We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture.  Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely.

Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially.  The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5.  It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously.  We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5.,After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade.,Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation.  We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments.  This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur.  After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely.  We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well.

She was taken to the operative suite, placed in a dorsal lithotomy position, and placed under IV sedation.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with the red Robinson catheter which produced approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was done, was performed by Dr. X and Dr. Z.  The uterus was found to be anteverted, mobile, fully involuted to a pre-pregnancy stage.  The cervix and vagina were grossly normal with no obvious masses or deformities.  A weighted speculum was placed in the posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.,The uterus was sounded to 8 cm.  The cervix was sterilely dilated with Hank dilator and then Hagar dilator.  At the time of blunt dilation, it was noticed that the dilator passed posteriorly with greater ease than it had previously.  The dilation was discontinued at that time because it was complete and the hysteroscope was placed into the uterus.  Under direct visualization, the ostia were within normal limits.  The endometrial lining was hyperplastic, however, there was no evidence of retained products or endometrial polyps.  The hyperplastic tissue did not appear to have calcification or other abnormalities.  There was a small area of the lower uterine segment posteriorly that was suspicious for endometrial perforation, however this area was hemostatic, no evidence of bowel involvement and was approximately 1 x 1 cm in nature.  The hysteroscope was removed and a sharp curette was placed intrauterine very carefully using a anterior wall for guidance.  Endometrial curettings were obtained and the posterior aspect suspicious for perforation was gently probed and seemed to have clamped down since the endometrial curetting.  The endometrial sampling was placed on Telfa pad and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  A rectal exam was performed at the end of the procedure which showed no hematoma formation in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was a normal consistency of the cervix and the normal step-off.  The uterine curette was removed as well as the vulsellum tenaculum and the weighted speculum.  The cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The patient was taken off the dorsal lithotomy position and recovered from her IV sedation in the recovery room.  The patient will be sent home once stable from anesthesia.

On laparoscopy in May of 2003, PID, adenomyosis, and uterine fibroids were demonstrated.  The patient desires definitive treatment.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY:  ,Uterus was retroverted and somewhat boggy on bimanual examination without any palpable adnexal abnormalities.  On laparoscopic examination, the uterus was quite soft and boggy consistent with the uterine adenomyosis.  There was also evidence of fibroid change in the right fundal aspect of the uterus.  There was a white exudative material covering the uterus as well as bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes.  There were filmy adhesions to the right pelvic side wall, as well as left pelvic side wall.,PROCEDURE: , The patient taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was initially placed and was noted to be draining clear to yellow urine.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The bladder was elevated and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus sounded to 7 cm and the cervix was then progressively dilated.  A #20 Hank dilator, which was left within the cervix used in conjunction with the vulsellum tenaculum as a uterine manipulator.  At this time, after the gloves were changed, attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen.  A small approximately 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made with the scalpel.  A Veress needle was then inserted through this incision and a pneumoperitoneum was created with CO2 gas with appropriate volumes and pressures.  A #10 mm step trocar was then inserted through this site and intraabdominal placing was confirmed with the laparoscope.  On entrance into the patient's abdomen and pelvis, survey of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the operative area to be relatively free of adhesions except for the right pelvic saddle in which there were filmy adhesions.  There was also white exudate noted covering the surface of the uterus and adnexa and the uterus had a quite boggy appearance.  At this time, under transillumination in the left anterior axillary line, a second incision was made with a scalpel and through this site a #12 mm step trocar was inserted under direct visualization by the laparoscope.  A third incision was made in the right anterior axillary line under transillumination and through this site a second #12 mm step trocar was placed under direct visualization by the laparoscope.  Then 2 cm above the pubic symphysis in the midline and fourth incision was made and a #5 mm step trocar was inserted through this site.  The uterus was elevated and deviated to the patient's right and infundibulopelvic ligament on the left was placed on tension with the aid of a grasper.  The Endo-GIA was placed through the left sided port and was fired was to cross the infundibulopelvic ligament and down passed to the level of the round ligament, transecting and stapling at the same time.  Attention was then turned to the right adnexa.,The uterus was brought over to the patient's left and the right infundibulopelvic ligament was placed on tension with the aid of a grasper.  An Endo-GIA was used to transect and staple this vasculature and down passed to the level of round ligament.  At this time, there was noted to be a small remnant of the round ligament on the right and a Harmonic scalpel was used to complete the transection and was found to be hemostatic.  In addition, on the left the same procedure was performed to completely transect the round ligament on the left and a good hemostasis was noted.  At this time, the uterus was dropped and the vesicouterine peritoneum was grasped with graspers.  The bladder was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of a Harmonic scalpel and hemostasis was appreciated.  The anterior cervix of the uterus was scored in the midline up to the level of the fundus with the aid of a Harmonic scalpel and then out to the adnexa bilaterally to aid in orientation during the vaginal portion of the procedure.  At this time, copious suction irrigation was performed and the operative sites were found to be hemostatic.  The pneumoperitoneum was the evacuated and the attention was then turned to the vaginal portion of the procedure.  The weighted speculum was placed into the patient's vagina.  At this time, the Foley catheter was noted to have ________ and there was noted to be a small puncture site noted into the Foley bulb.  The Foley catheter was replaced and the bladder was to be filled at a later time with methylene blue to rule out any bladder injury during the laparoscopic part of the procedure.  The cervix was then grasped from right to left with a Lahey clamps and the anterior vaginal mucosa was placed on stretch with aid of Allis clamps.  The vaginal mucosa anteriorly was then incised with aid of a scalpel from the 9 o'clock position to 3 o'clock position.  The anterior vaginal mucosa and bladder were suctioned and were then dissected away from the lower uterine segment with the aid of Mayo scissors and blunt dissection until anteriorly the peritoneal cavity was entered at which time the peritoneal incision was extended bluntly.  Next, using Lahey clamps serially following the ________ placed by the Harmonic scalpel from above were followed up to the pubic uterine fundus until the uterus was delivered into the vagina anteriorly.  At this time, two curved Heaney clamps were placed across the uterine artery on the right.  This was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The second clamp was advanced to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex and this was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  Attention was then turned to the left uterine artery which was again doubly clamped with curved Heaney clamps, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  This second clamp was then advanced to capture the vasculature and the cardinal ligament complex.  This was again transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.,Next, the uterosacral were clamped off with the curved Heaney clamps and this clamp was met in the midline by another clamp just underneath the cervix and clamping off of the vaginal cuff.  Next the uterus, ovaries and cervix were transected away from the vaginal cuff with the aid of double pointed scissors and this specimen was handed off to pathology.  At this time, the bladder was instilled with approximately 800 cc of methylene blue and there was no evidence of any leak of blue dye as could be seen from the prospective of the vaginal portion of the procedure.  Next, the posterior vaginal cuff and posterior peritoneum were incorporated in a running lock stitch of #0 Chromic beginning at the 9'o clock position over to the 3'o clock position.  Next, the anterior vaginal mucosa was grasped with the Allis clamp and the peritoneum was identified anteriorly.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then closed with #0 Chromic suture figure-of-eight stitch with care taken to incorporate the anterior vaginal mucosa, the anterior peritoneum, and the previously closed posterior vaginal mucosa and the posterior peritoneum.  Two additional sutures medially were placed and these were tagged and not tied in place.  A #0 Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle was used to perform the McCall's culdoplasty type approximation with the vaginal cuff to open and the uterosacral ligament visualized.  This was then tied in place and the remainder of the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Chromic suture with figure-of-eight stitches.  At this time, the gloves were changed and attention was returned to the laparoscopic portion of the procedure at which time the abdomen was re-insufflated and the patient was placed in Trendelenburg.  The bowel was moved out of the way and copious suction irrigation was performed and all operative areas were noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder was again filled with approximately 400 cc methylene blue and from the laparoscopic ________ point there was no evidence of leakage of blue dye at this time.  The pneumoperitoneum was then evacuated and a cystoscopy was performed filling the bladder with approximately 400 cc of normal saline and there was noted to be a pinpoint perforation right on bladder dome which was found to be hemostatic and was not found to have any leakage at this time.  The bladder was then drained and the Foley catheter was replaced and after gloves changed, attention was turned to the abdomen with the laparoscopic instruments removed from the patient's abdomen.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine in total were injected at incision site for additional analgesia.  The Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and taken to recovery in stable condition.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The specimens include the uterus, cervix, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes.

This patient had approximately greater than ten years of chronic pelvic pain with dysmenorrhea which has significantly affected her activities of daily living.  Symptoms have not improved with prescription of oral contraceptives.,The patient has had one prior surgery for a left ovarian cystectomy done by laparoscopy in 1996.  The cyst was not diagnosed as an endometrioma.  The patient does desire future fertility; however, would like a definitive diagnosis.  Conservative medical therapy was offered i.e.  Lupron or repeat oral contraceptives, but declined.,FINDINGS:,  Bimanual exam reveals a small retroverted uterus which is easily mobile.  There were no adnexal masses.  The cervix was normal on palpation.  A fibrotic band was noted at the internal os during dilation.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus was found to be small with mild spongy texture.  On palpation, the right ovary and adnexa were grossly normal with no evidence of endometriosis.  The left ovary was grossly normal.  The left fallopian tube had a mild hydrosalpinx present.  The left uterosacral ligament had three to four 1 mm to 2 mm lesions that were vesicular in nature consistent with endometriosis.  The vesicouterine reflection in the anterior aspect of the uterus were within normal limits as were the posterior cul-de-sac.  The liver appeared grossly normal.  There were no obvious pelvic adhesions.  The left internal inguinal ring is somewhat patent, however, there is no bowel or viscera protruding through it.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was seen in the preop suite.  History was reviewed and all questions were answered.  The patient was then taken to the operative suite where she was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube.  She was placed in a dorsal lithotomy position in Allen stirrups.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter producing approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was performed by Dr. X, Dr. Y, and Dr. Z with above findings noted.  A sterile weighted speculum was placed in posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior aspect of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  There was an attempt to place the uterine sound through the external and internal cervical os, however, secondary to a fibrotic band at the internal os that was impossible.  A #9 dilator was allowed to remain in the cervix for minimal manipulation while attention was then turned to the abdomen.  An infraumbilical incision was made using skin scalpel.  The Veress needle was placed and CO2 was insufflated.  It was immediately noticed that the pressures were inconsistent with intraabdominal insufflation and the CO2 was discontinued and Veress needle was completely removed.  A second attempt placement of the Veress needle into the abdomen was successful and CO2 was insufflated approximately 3 liters with minimal intraabdominal pressure.  The #12 port was placed and the laparoscope was inserted.  Attention was then turned back to the uterus and with the assistance of current hemostat to bluntly dissect the fibrotic band of the internal os.,Successful sounding of the uterus showed an 8-cm uterus that was in a retroverted position.  The cervix was serially dilated using Hank dilators to allow for introduction of the sharp curette.  A curettage was then performed and specimen of the endometrium was sent for pathologic evaluation.  This procedure was performed under direct laparoscopic visualization.  Laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis was performed and the above findings noted.  A second abdominal incision was performed suprapubically using a skin scalpel and the Veress needle was placed through the incision successfully under direct visualization.  A #5 port was then placed through the sheath and the uterine manipulator was used to complete visualization.  The manipulator was then removed and the Harmonic scalpel was placed through the #5 port.  The Harmonic scalpel was used then to ablate the 1 mm vesicular lesions on the left uterosacral ligament.  The lesions were suspect for endometriosis, however, they were not diagnostic of endometriosis.  There was also present a 3 mm to 5 mm submucosal uterine fibroid on the right lower uterine segment.  The Harmonic scalpel was removed from the abdomen as was the #5 port.  The incision was internally found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope was then removed from the abdomen.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced into the #12 port and the #12 port was removed from the abdomen.  The uterine manipulator was removed from the uterus and the cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was then removed.  The patient taken out of dorsal lithotomy position.  She was recovered from general anesthesia and taken to the postoperative suite for complete recovery.  The patient's discharge instructions will include a followup in one to two weeks in Dr. X's office for discussion of pathology.  Her family was notified of the findings.

Surgically, the patient has an enlarged fibroid uterus with a large fundal/anterior fibroids, which is approximately 6+ cm and several small submucosal fibroids within the endometrium.  Both ovaries and tubes appeared within normal limits.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where she was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position.  After the general anesthetic was found to be adequate, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife.  This was carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with the second knife and the fascial incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying layer of rectus muscle bluntly.  It was then dissected in the middle with the Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified with hemostat clamps, tented up, and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors and then extended bluntly.  Next, the uterus was grasped bluntly and removed from the abdomen.  The fundal fibroid was identified.  It was then injected with vasopressin, 20 units mixed in 30 cc of normal saline along the serosal surface and careful to aspirate to avoid any blood vessels.  15 cc was injected.  Next, the point tip was used with the cautery _______ cutting to cut the linear incision along the top of the _______ fibroid until fibroid fibers were seen.  The edges of the myometrium was grasped with Allis clamps, tented up, and a hemostat was used to bluntly dissect around the fibroid followed by blunt dissection with a finger.  The fibroid was easily and bluntly dissected out.  It was also grasped with Lahey clamp to prevent traction.  Once the blunt dissection of the large fibroid was complete, it was handed off to the scrub nurse.  The large fibroid traversed the whole myometrium down to the mucosal surface and the endometrial cavity was largely entered when this fibroid was removed.  At this point, several smaller fibroids were noticed along the endometrial surface of the uterus.  Three of these were removed just by bluntly grasping with the Lahey clamp and twisting, all three of these were approximately 1 cm to 2 cm in size.  These were also handed to the scrub tech.  Next, the uterine incision was then closed with first two interrupted layers of #0 chromic in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion and then with a #0 Vicryl in a running baseball stitch.  The uterus was seen to be completely hemostatic after closure.  Next, a 3 x 4 inch piece of Interceed was placed over the incision and dampened with normal saline.  The uterus was then carefully returned to the abdomen and being careful not to disturb the Interceed.  Next, the greater omentum was replaced over the uterus.,The rectus muscles were then reapproximated with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl in the midline.  Then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Next, the Scarpa's fascia was closed with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.

At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot.  The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well.  Dr. A was present throughout the entire case.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The patient has a long history of crippling severe rheumatoid arthritis.  She has pain with shoe gear and pain with every step.  She has tried multiple conservative measures under Dr. X's supervision consisting of wide shoe's and accommodative padding all which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical reconstruction/correction.  The consent is available on the chart for review and the risks versus benefits of this procedure have been discussed with patient in detail by Dr. X.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field.  The sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe.  In addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray.  There was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal.  Using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection.  The joint capsule was then visualized.  Two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule.  A dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal  phalanx.,A large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint.  In addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal.  Upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head.  A sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare.  Next, the bone was passed out as specimen.  The head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation.  The tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue.  This was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed.  The fibular sesamoid was in the interspace.  A lateral release was performed in addition.  Next, the McGlamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed.  The metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure.  Next, the Biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint.  A small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx.  The trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed.,Next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A median large porous Biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position.  It had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level.  Next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion.  A medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature.  There was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.,Next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint.  The tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  The bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded.  The base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage.  A sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  Next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft.  The toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position.  An extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated.  The same suture material was used and the same 0.045 Kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation.,Attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated.  The same suture material was used.  However, a 0.062 Kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 Kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight.  Next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  The toe assumed to more rectus position.  The reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces.  The joint was again flushed with saline.  Next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  The skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique.,Next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin.  A #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively.  Next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  Hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly.  A sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  A bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures.  The skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 Monocryl.  Attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated.  Therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The tendon was transected.  Next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed.  Next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position.  One #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin.,Mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds.  Betadine-soaked Owen silk was applied to all wounds.  Betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  All the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped.  A standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  She was given prescription for Tylenol #3, #40 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c.  She is to continue her rheumatoid arthritis drugs preoperatively prescribed by the rheumatologist.,She is to follow up with Dr. X in the office.  She was given emergency contact numbers and standard postoperative instructions.  She was given Darco OrthoWedge shoe and a pair of crutches.

The patient with continued symptoms of pelvic pain and hypermenorrhea and desired definitive surgical treatment.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY: , Uterus is anteverted and boggy with a very narrow introitus with a palpable left adnexal mass.,On laparotomy, the uterus was noted to be slightly enlarged with fibroid change as well as a hemorrhagic appearing left adnexal mass.  The bowel, omentum, and appendix had a normal appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with a scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline.  The fascial incision was then extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kochers with the underlying rectus muscle dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of this incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up with the underlying rectus muscle and dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus and left adnexa were then palpated and brought out into the surgical field.  The fundus of the uterus was grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges and the extension through GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  At this time, the patient's anatomy was surveyed and there was found to be a left hemorrhagic appearing adnexal mass.  Attention was first turned to the right round ligament, which was tented up with a Babcock and a small window was made beneath the round ligament with a hemostat.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected with the broad ligament being skeletonized on both sides.  Next, the right ________ was isolated bluntly as the patient had a previous RSO.  This was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  Attention was then turned to the left round ligament, which was tented up with the Babcock.  Small window was made beneath it and the broad ligament with hemostat was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected, and skeletonized with the aid of Metzenbaums.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then bluntly isolated.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  The bladder flap was then placed on tension with Allis clamps.  It was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of Metzenbaum scissors and Russians.  It was then gently pushed off of lower uterine segment with the aid of a moist Ray-Tec.  The uterine arteries were then skeletonized bilaterally.,They were then clamped with straight Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The cardinal ligament and uterosacral complexes on both sides were then clamped with curved Kocher clamps.  These were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The lower uterine segment was then grasped with Lahey clamps, at which time the cervix was already visible.  It was then entered with the last transection.  The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum and the uterus, cervix, and left adnexa were amputated off the vagina with the aid of Jorgenson scissors.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then grasped with Kocher clamps.  A Betadine-soaked Ray-Tec was then pushed into the vagina and the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Vicryl suture in a running lock fashion with care taken to transect the ipsilateral cardinal ligament, at which time the suction tip was changed and copious suction irrigation was performed.  Good hemostasis was appreciated.  A figure-of-eight suture in the center of the vaginal cuff was placed with #0 Vicryl.  This was tagged for later use.  The uterosacrals on both sides were incorporated into the vaginal cuff with the aid of #0 Vicryl suture.  The round ligaments were then pulled into the vaginal cuff using the figure-of-eight suture placed in the center of the vaginal cuff and these were tied in place.  The pelvis was then again copiously suctioned irrigated and hemostasis was appreciated.  The peritoneal surfaces were then reapproximated with the aid of #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The GYN/Balfour retractor and bladder blade were then removed.  The bowel was then packed.  Again copious suction irrigation was performed with hemostasis appreciated.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The Scarpa's  fascia was then reapproximated with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Steri-Strips were placed.  At the end of the procedure, the sponge that was pushed into the vagina previously was removed and hemostasis was appreciated vaginally.

However, on exam unable to delineate the facial structures, but definite fetal malpresentation.  The fetal heart tones did start and it continued to have variable decelerations with contractions overall are reassuring.  The contraction pattern was inadequate.  It was discussed with the patient's family that in light of the physical exam and with the fetal malpresentation that a cesarean section will be recommended.  All the questions were answered.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with a leftward tilt.  Prior to this, the spinal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was then prepped and draped.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was then grasped with Ochsners, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The superior portion and inferior portion of the rectus fascia was identified, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was then identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then gently stretched.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with an Allis and the bladder flap was created bluntly as well as using Metzenbaum scissors.  The uterus was entered with the second scalpel and large transverse incision.  This was then extended in upward and lateral fashion bluntly.  The infant was then delivered atraumatically.

The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility.  The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy.,FINDINGS: , At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room.  A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.,The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach.  A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum.  Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field.  The left testicle was examined.  A large spermatocele was noted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele.  Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis.  Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis.  Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord.  The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors.  Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends.  Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position.  The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic.  Attention was then turned to the right side.  The vas was palpated in the scrotum.  A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field.  A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat.  Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery.  Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum.  A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision.  Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied.  The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition.  He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., for five days and Vicodin ES 1 p.o. q.4h. p.r.n., pain, #30 for pain.

There is also evidence of bilateral internal as well as external nasal valve collapse.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who had undergone a previous septorhinoplasty after significant trauma in his 20s.  He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.

Mumford procedure left shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting.  After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side.  All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum.  The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact.  Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis.  Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in.  A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out.  Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff.  Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was directed subacromially.  A portal was created laterally.  Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver.  #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this.,It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200.  Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure.  Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured.  An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Flaps were created.  Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly.  Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp.  An excellent decompression was present.  CA ligament had been previously resected.  We then took the incision over the distal clavicle.  The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw.  The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges.  Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl.  Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same.  A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing.  0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure.  Pain buster catheter was hooked up.  The patient's arm was placed in arm sling.  He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

She did complain of some dyspareunia and wants a definitive diagnosis.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus is small and anteverted with mildly decreased mobility on the left side.  There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus is normal appearing but slightly compressible.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appear normal.  There is evidence of endometriosis on the left pelvic sidewall in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was no endometriosis in the right pelvic sidewall or along the bladder flap.,There were some adhesions on the right abdominal sidewall from the previous appendectomy.  The liver margin, gallbladder, and bowel appeared normal.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A sharp curettage was performed until a gritty texture was noted in all aspects of the endometrium.  The moderate amount of tissue that was obtained was sent to Pathology.  The #20 Hank dilator was then replaced and the sterile speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  The Veress needle was placed into this incision and the gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  The #11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and a camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A Bierman needle was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline to allow a better visualization of the pelvic organs.  A 5 mm port was placed approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the right of the umbilicus and approximately 3 cm inferior.  The harmonic scalpel was placed through this port and the areas of endometriosis were ablated using the harmonic scalpel.  A syringe was placed on to the Bierman needle and a small amount of fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac was removed to allow better visualization of the posterior cul-de-sac.  The lesions in the posterior cul-de-sac were then ablated using the Harmonic scalpel.  All instruments were then removed.  The Bierman needle and 5 mm port was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.  The skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  ,Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was placed in the incision sites.  The dilator and vulsellum tenaculum were removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of procedure.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,HISTORY: , This 50-year-old gentleman was from the area and riding his motorcycle in Kentucky.,The patient lost control of his motorcycle when he was traveling approximately 40 mile per hour.  He was on a curve and lost control.  He is unsure what exactly happened, but he thinks his right ankle was pinned underneath the motorcycle while he was sliding.  There were no other injuries.  He was treated in Kentucky.  A close reduction was performed and splint applied.  Orthopedic surgeon called myself with regards to this patient's fracture management and suggested a CT scan.  The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight.  The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed.  This was performed and reviewed.  The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days.  At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait.,Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches.  The patient was x-rayed in the office.  He had lost some of his reduction.  Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin.,An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally.  It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation.  This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted.,The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type.  The syndesmosis appeared to be intact.  This appeared as an AO type B fracture.  However, this was not a rotational injury.,There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted.  CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner.  A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate.  However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint.,There were many fragments and defects in this region.,The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment.,We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient.  He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness.  We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan.  We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery.  We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness.  Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot.,The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse.,The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly.  We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions.  We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally.  He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly.,We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula.  We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction.  He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space.  With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future.  We discussed hardware irritation.  We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly.  With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure.,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic.  His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction.  It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular.,The reduction appeared to line up.  However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia.,A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue.  The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided.  The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula.,This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally.  The fracture was seen.  The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated.  The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect.  The posterior aspect was still intact.  However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury.  This was reduced manually.  At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon.  No sharp dissection was performed.  The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced.  The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well.,X-ray views confirmed this.,An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus.  This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue.  The saphenous vein was found, dissected out.  Its branches were cauterized.  Penrose drain was placed around this.,Dissection was undertaken.  The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint.,This was recovered and flipped back on both sides.  Next, the towel clip was used.  Ends were freshened up using irrigation.  The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially.,Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws.  Anatomic reduction was gained.  X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction.  Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula.  Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this.  Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture.  Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used.,The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction.  Screws were placed.  It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially.,Screw holes were filled.  They were double-checked.  Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up.  At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond.  This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia.,The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment.,A 2 mm K-wire was used.  Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger.  X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin.  This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed.  This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so.  On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint.  AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint.  One could palpate this as well.  The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane.  At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint.  There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment.  Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage.  Posterior splint was placed on the patient.  The patient's leg was placed in neutral position.  Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings.  The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding.  Tourniquet was deflated.  The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications.  Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied.  Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant.  As well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue.  The patient is expected to do well overall.  He does have an area of comminution shown on the CT scan.  However, by x-rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment.  Nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The ultrasound showed right adnexal mass with crown-rump length measuring consistent with an 8 weeks gestation and a moderate free fluid in the abdominal cavity.  Given these findings as well as physical examination findings a recommendation was made proceed with an exploratory laparotomy and right salpingectomy.  The procedure was discussed with the patient in detail including risks of bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding organs and possible need for further surgery.  Informed consult was obtained prior to proceeding with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was administered without difficulty.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia using the Bovie.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  Kocher clamps were used to grasp the superior aspect of the fascial incision, which was elevated and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly using Mayo scissors, attention was then turned to the inferior aspect, which was grasped with Kocher clamps, elevated and the underlying rectus muscles dissected up bluntly using Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscles were dissected in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified using blunt dissection and entered in this manner and extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this time, the blood found in the abdomen was suctioned.  The bowel was packed with moist laparotomy sponge.  The right ectopic pregnancy was identified.

A scalpel was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision, which was carried down sharply through the subcutaneous tissue to the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the midline and incision was carried laterally bilaterally with curved Mayo scissors.  The fascia was then bluntly and sharply dissected free from the underlying rectus abdominis muscles.  The rectus abdominis muscles were then bluntly dissected in the midline and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The peritoneum was then bluntly entered and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The O'Connor-O'Sullivan instrument was then placed without difficulty.  The uterus was grasped with a thyroid clamp and the entire pelvis was then visualized without difficulty.  The GIA stapling instrument was then used to separate the infundibulopelvic ligament in a ligated fashion from the body of the uterus.  This was performed on the left infundibulopelvic ligament and the right infundibulopelvic ligament without difficulty.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  The bladder flap was then developed free from the uterus without difficulty.  Careful dissection of the uterus from the pedicle with the uterine arteries and cardinal ligaments was then performed using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion on the left and right side.  This was done without difficulty.  The uterine fundus was then separated from the uterine cervix without difficulty.  This specimen was sent to pathology for identification.  The cervix was then developed with careful dissection.  Jorgenson scissors were then used to remove the cervix from the vaginal cuff.  This was sent to pathology for identification.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  A #1 chromic suture ligature was then used in running fashion at the angles and along the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  Figure-of-eight sutures were then used in an interrupted fashion to close the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  The entire pelvis was washed.  Hemostasis was noted.  The peritoneum was then closed using 2-0 chromic suture ligature in running pursestring fashion.  The rectus abdominis muscles were approximated using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion.  The fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in interlocking running fashion.  Foundation sutures were then placed in an interrupted fashion for further closing the fascia.  The skin was closed with staple gun.  Sponge and needle counts were noted to be correct x2 at the end of the procedure.  Instrument count was noted to be correct x2 at the end of the procedure.

Lower tract outlet obstructive symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy.,3.  Inability to pass a Foley catheter x3.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Cystoscopy.,2.  Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).,ANESTHESIA: , General laryngeal mask.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 61-year-old white male who has been treated at the VA in Houston for a bladder cancer.  His history dates back to 2003 when he had a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.  He had multiple cystoscopies and followups since that time with no evidence of recurrence.  However, on recent cystoscopy, he had what appeared to be a recurrent tumor and was taken to the operating room and had this resected with findings of a Ta grade III transitional cell carcinoma associated with carcinoma in situ.  Retrograde pyelograms were suspicious on the right and cleared with ureteroscopy and the left renal pelvic washing was positive but this may represent contamination from the lower urinary tract as radiographically, there were no abnormalities.  I had cystoscoped the patient in the office showed during the period of time when he had significant irritative burning symptoms, and there were still healing biopsy sites.  We elected to allow his bladder to recover before starting the BCG.  We were ready to do that last week but two doctors and a nurse including myself were unable to pass Foley catheter.  I repeated a cystoscopy in the office with findings of a high bladder neck and BPH.  After a lengthy discussion with the patient and his wife, we elected to proceed with TURP after a full informed consent.,FINDINGS: , At cystoscopy, there was bilobular prostatic hyperplasia and a very high riding bladder neck, which may have been the predominant cause of his difficulty catheterizing and obstructive symptoms.  There were mucosal changes on the left posterior wall in the midline suspicious for carcinoma in situ.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23 French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings as described.  We removed the cystoscope and passed a #28 French continuous flow resectoscope sheath under visual obturator after dilating the meatus to #32 French with van Buren sounds.  Inspection of bladder again was made noting the location of the ureteral orifices relative to the bladder neck.  The groove was cut at 6 o'clock to open the bladder neck to verumontanum and then the left lobe was resected from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  Hemostasis was achieved, and then a similar procedure performed in the right side.  We resected the anterior stromal tissue and the apical tissue and then obtained complete hemostasis.  Chips were removed with Ellik evacuator.  There was no bleeding at the conclusion of the procedure, and the resectoscope was removed.  A #24 French three-way Foley catheter was placed with efflux of clear irrigant.  The patient was returned to the supine position, awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

A six hole one-third tibial plate, one 12 mm 3.5 mm cortical screw fully threaded and two 16 mm 3.5 mm cortical fully-threaded screws.  There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed.  There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall.  The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell.  The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room.  At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint.  After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained.  The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient.  This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes.  Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle.  A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.  Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified.  The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site.  The wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position.  There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone.  It was held in place with reduction forceps.  A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation.  It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula.  Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each.  The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length.  Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole.  The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length.  Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position.  There was no lateralization of the joints.  Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle.  Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus.  Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site.  The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures.  Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum.  The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus.  There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies.  Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire.  Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length.  These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position.  Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws.  They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint.  At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril.  A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity.  This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

She has been hospitalized multiple times for intractable nausea and vomiting and dehydration.  She states that her decreased p.o. intake has been progressively worsening.  She was admitted to the service of Dr. Lang and was evaluated by Dr. Wickless as well all of whom agreed that the best option for supplemental nutrition for this patient was placement of a PEG tube.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, complications, and benefits were explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  She was placed in the supine position.  The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.  The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty.  There was no gross evidence of any malignancy.  There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam.  The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach.  This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine.  Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization.  A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed.  A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well.  A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach.  The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away.  Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope.  The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture.  Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition.

She had severe dyspareunia and chronic suprapelvic pain.  The patient had had a prior left salpingoophorectomy laparoscopically in 2004 for same disease process.  Now, she presented with a recurrent right ovarian endometrioma and severe pelvic pain.  She desired surgical treatment.  She accepted risk of a complete hysterectomy and salpingoophorectomy, risk of injury to underlying organs.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were clearly discussed with the patient as documented in the medical record.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , Absent left adnexa.  Right ovary about 6 cm with chocolate cyst and severely adherent to the right pelvic side wall, uterus, and colon.  Careful dissection to free right ovary and remove it although it is likely that some ovarian tissue remains behind.  Ureter visualized and palpated on right and appears normal.  Indigo carmine given IV with no leaks intraperitoneally noted.  Sigmoid colon dissected free from back of uterus and from cul-de-sac.  Bowel free of lacerations or denudation.  Upon inspection, right tube with hydrosalpinx, appendix absent.  Omental adhesions to ensure abdominal wall was lysed.,TECHNICAL PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent smooth induction of general anesthesia.  She was placed in a supine position with a transurethral Foley in place and compression stockings in place.  The abdomen and vagina were thoroughly prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried down sharply to the underlying layer of fascia and peritoneum.  The peritoneum was bluntly entered and the incision extended caudally and cephaladly with good visualization of underlying organs.  Next, exploration of the abdominal and pelvic organs revealed the above noted findings.  The uterus was enlarged and probably contained adenomyosis.  There were dense adhesions, and a large right endometrioma with a chocolate cyst-like material contained within.  The sigmoid colon was densely adhered to the cul-de-sac into the posterior aspect of the uterus.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed into the incision, and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Next, a sharp and blunt dissection was used to free the extensive adhesions, and enterolysis was performed with very careful attention not to injure or denude the bowel.  Next, the left round ligament and cornual region was divided, transected, and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and opened anteriorly to the level of the bladder.  The uterine arteries were skeletonized on the left, and these were suture-clamped and transected with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the bladder flap was developed anteriorly, and the bladder peritoneum was sharply and bluntly dissected off of the lower uterus.,On the right, a similar procedure was performed.  The right round ligament was suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  It was transected and divided with electrocautery.  The anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and developed anteriorly and posteriorly, and this area was relatively avascular.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was identified.  It was cross-clamped and transected, suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the uterine arteries were skeletonized on the right.  They were transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The uterosacral ligaments were taken bilaterally and transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The cardinal ligaments were taken near their insertion into the cervical and uterine tissue.  Pedicles were sharply developed and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  Next, the electrocautery was used to dissect the cervix anteriorly from the underlying vagina.  Once entry into the vagina was made, the cervix and uterus were amputated with Jorgensen scissors.  The vaginal cuff angles were suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb and transfixed to the ipsilateral, cardinal, and uterosacral ligaments for vaginal support.  The remainder of the vagina was closed with figure-of-eight sutures in an interrupted fashion with good hemostasis noted.,Next, the right ovarian tissue was densely adherent to the colon.  It was sharply and bluntly dissected, and most of the right ovary and endometrioma was removed and dissected off completely; however, there is a quite possibility that small remnants of ovarian tissue were left behind.  The right ureter was seen and palpated.  It did not appear to be dilated and had good peristalsis noted.  Next, the retractors were removed.  The laparotomy sponges were removed from the abdomen.  The rectus fascia was closed with 0 Polysorb in a continuous running fashion with 2 sutures meeting in the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with 0 plain gut in an interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Polysorb in a subcuticular fashion.  A thin layer of Dermabond was placed.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x 2.

He also had some comminution of the medial femoral condyle which prohibited an anatomic key between the two segments of the medial condyle.,IMPLANTS:, We used 2.4 and 3.5 cortical screws, as well as a LISS Synthes femoral locking plate.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,IV FLUIDS:, 2000,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 40 mL,URINE OUTPUT:, 650,HISTORY: ,This 45-year-old male had a ground-level fall, sustaining this injury. He was admitted for definitive operative fixation. Risks and benefits were discussed, he agreed to go ahead with the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient was identified in preop holding, then taken to the operating room. Once adequate anesthesia was obtained, his left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. He was given antibiotics. He placed a traction pin through his proximal tibia, and pulled weight off the end of the bed. I made a midline approach and then did the lateral parapatellar arthrotomy. We excised some of the fat pad to give us better visibility into the notch. We excised a good bit of his synovium and synovial pouch. At this time we were able to identify the fracture fragments. Again, there was an intercondylar split and then two free pieces of the medial condyle. The femur fracture was very distal through the metaphysis. At this time we thoroughly cleaned out all the clot between all the fracture fragments and cleaned the cortical margins.,Next we began the reduction. There was no reduction key between the two segments of the Hoffa fracture. Therefore, we reduced the anterior portion of the medial condyle to the lateral condyle, held it with point-of-reduction clamp and K-wires, and then secured it with 2.4 mini fragment lag screws. Next, with this medial anterior piece in place, we had some contour over the notch with which we were able to reduce the posterior medial Hoffa fragment. This gave us a nice notch contour. Again, there was some comminution laterally so that the fracture between the Hoffa segments did not have a perfect key. Once we had it reduced, based on the notch reduction, we then held it with K-wires. We secured it with two 3.5 cortical screws from the lateral condyle into this posterior segment. We then secured it with 2.4 cortical screws from the anterior medial to the posterior medial segment just subchondral. Then, finally, we secured it with a 3.5 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial piece. All screws ran between and out of the notch.,With the condyle now well reduced, we reduced it to the metaphysis. We slid a 13-hole LISS plate submuscularly. We checked on AP and lateral views that showed we had good reduction of the fracture and appropriate plate placement. We placed the tip threaded guidewire through the A-hole of the plate jig and got it parallel to the joint. We then clamped the plate down to the bone. Proximally, we made a stab incision for the trocar at the 13-hole position, placed our tip threaded guidewire in the lateral aspect of the femur, checked it on lateral view, and had it in good position.,With the jig in appropriate position and clamped, we then proceeded to fill the distal locking screws to get purchase into the condyles. We then placed multiple unicortical locking screws in the shaft and metaphyseal segment. Our most proximal screw was proximal to the tip of the prosthesis.,At this time we took the jig off and put the final screw into the A-hole of the plate. We then took final C-arm views which showed we had a good reduction on AP and lateral views, the plate was in good position, we had full range of motion of the knee, and good reduction clinically and radiographically. We then pulse lavaged the knee with 3 liters of fluid. We closed the quad tendon and lateral retinaculum with interrupted 0 Vicryl over a Hemovac drain. Subdermal tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied.

Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.,The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.,Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.

The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A longitudinal incision was made in line with the 4th ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease.  The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis.  The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially from 2-3 mm and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf.,The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat.  The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat.  The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors.,After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl.  Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture.  A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed.  The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches.,The first dorsal compartment was addressed through a transverse incision at the level of the radial styloid tip.  Dissection was carried down with care taken to avoid and protect the superficial radial nerve branches.  I released the compartment in a separate subsheath for the EPB on the dorsal side.  Both ends of the sheath were released to lengthen them, and then these were repaired with 4-0 Vicryl.  It was checked to make sure that there was significant room remaining for the tendons.  This was done to prevent postoperative subluxation.,I then irrigated and closed the wounds in layers.  Marcaine with epinephrine was placed into all wounds, and dressings and splint were placed.

She was seen and evaluated.  On routine mammography, revealed a density in the left breast approximately at 4 o'clock position several centimeters lateral to the nipple complex.  She was readmitted for excisional biopsy.,Due to the nonpalpable nature of this lesion, the patient underwent first needle localization of the breast at the  Hospital and was taken to the operating room.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  After appropriate general endotracheal anesthesia has been administered to the patient, the left breast was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion using Betadine solution.,The localization wire was cut at skin.  The patient had previously had a reduction mammoplasty in the lateral aspect of the transverse where an incision was re-incised to distance of about 4 cm.  The wire was entering the skin about 2 cm above the incision.  Superior skin flap was raised using electrocautery, and the needle localization wire was brought into the incision.  At this point, a core breast tissue of approximately 2 cm surrounding the needle was excised superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally until the tissue specimen was well below the hook of the needle localization wire.,The breast specimen was then removed from breast, and silk sutures were used to mark the superior and lateral margins.  This specimen was then sent for mammography.  Pathologist called in the room to verify that the entire needle localization wire and hook were intact in the specimen.

After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion.  After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated.  The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally.  A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally.,After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon.  The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected.  A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case.  The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed.  The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally.  The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided.  The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns.  The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight.  The wound was irrigated.  The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples.  Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa.  A posterior splint was applied.  Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation of the prostate.,FINDINGS:  ,After measurement of the prostate, we decided to place 5 rows of needles--row #1 had 3 needles, row #2 at the level of the mid-prostate had 4 needles, row #3 had 2 needles in the right lateral peripheral zone, row #4 was a single needle directly the urethra, and in row #5 were 2 needles placed in the left lateral peripheral zone.  Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure.  After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder.  Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum.  An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured.  Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement.  Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate.  Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra.  Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed.  The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted.  After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior.  The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself.  Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 23-year-old gentleman who was involved in a crush injury to his right wrist.  He was placed into a well-molded splint after reduction was performed in the emergency department.  Further x-rays showed further distal fragment dorsal angulation that progressively worsened and it was felt that surgical intervention was warranted.  All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of the surgery were explained to the patient in detail, and he signed the informed consent for ORIF of the right wrist.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operative table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The right upper extremity had a well-padded tourniquet placed on the right arm, which was insufflated and maintained for 40 minutes at 250 mmHg pressure.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 5-cm incision was made over the flexor carpi radialis of the right wrist.  The skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the deep tissue was retracted, blunt dissection was performed down to the pronator quadratus.  Sharp dissection was performed through the pronator quadratus after which a tissue elevator was used to elevate this tissue.  Next, a reduction was performed placing the distal fragment into appropriate alignment.  This was checked under fluoroscopy, and was noted to be adequately reduced and in appropriate position.  An Acumed Accu-lock plate was placed along the volar aspect of the distal radius.  This was checked under AP and lateral views with C-arm, noted to be in appropriate alignment.  A 3.5-mm cortical screw was placed through the proximal aspect of the plate, positioned it into position.  Two distal locking screws were placed along the plate itself.  The screws were checked under AP and lateral views noting the fracture fragment was well aligned and appropriately reduced with the 2 screws being placed into appropriate position with the appropriate length as well as not being intraarticular.  Four more screws were placed along the distal aspect of the plate and 2 more proximal along the plate.  All locking screws placed into position and had excellent purchase into the bone or had excellent fixation into the plate and maintained the alignment of the fracture.  AP and lateral views were taken of these screw placements again.  None of these screws were into the joint and all had appropriate length into the dorsal cortex.  Two more 3.5 fully threaded cortical screws were placed along the proximal aspect of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase.  AP and lateral views were taken of the wrist once again showing that this was appropriate reduction of the fracture as well as appropriate placement of the screws.  Bicortical purchase was appreciated and no screws were placed into the joint.  The wound itself was copiously irrigated with saline and Kantrex after which the subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 nylon stitch; 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the wound site after which sterile dressing was placed as well as the volar splint.

He landed mostly on the right arm.  He noted some bleeding at the time of the injury and a small puncture wound.  He was taken to the emergency room and diagnosed a compound both bone forearm fracture, and based on this, he was seen for malalignment.,He was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure was discussed at length with the patient's parents and they understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain on full range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for repeat debridement, risk of need for internal fixation, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  They understood these well.  All questions were answered and they signed the consent for procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The right forearm was inspected.  There was noted to be a 3-mm puncture-type wound over the volar aspect of the forearm in the middle one-third overlying the radial one-half.  There was bleeding in this region.  No gross contamination was seen.  At this point, under fluoroscopic control, I did attempt to see a fracture.  I was unable to do the forearm under the close reduction techniques.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  An incision was made through the puncture wound site extending this proximally and distally.  There was noted to be some slight amount of nonviable tissue at the skin edge and debridement was required and performed.  I also did perform a light debridement of the nonviable subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and small bony fragments were also removed.  These were all completely debrided appropriately and then at this point, a thorough irrigation was performed of the radius, which I communicated through the puncture wound.  Both ends were clearly visualized, and thorough irrigation was performed using total of 6 L of antibiotic solution.  All nonviable gross contaminated tissue was removed.  At this point with the bones in direct visualization, I did reduce the bony ends to anatomic alignment with excellent bony approximation.  Proper alignment of tissue and angulation was confirmed.,At this point, under fluoroscopic control confirmed the radius and ulna in anatomic position, which will be completely displaced and shortened previously.  The ulna was now also noted to be in anatomic alignment.,At this point, the region was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis confirmed and closure then begun.  The skin was reapproximated using 3-0 nylon suture.  The visual puncture wound region was left open and this was intact with the depth of the wound down the bone using 1.5-inch Nugauze with iodoform.  Sterile dressing applied and a long-arm cast with the forearm in neutral position was applied.  X-ray with fluoroscopic evaluation was performed, which confirmed.

Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue.  The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection.  The right lower lobe was identified.  There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not.  Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe.  Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected.  The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected.  Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected.  The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis.  The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free.  The mediastinum was then explored.  No nodes were identified around the pulmonary ligament or around the esophagus.  Subcarinal nodes were dissected, and hemostasis was obtained with clips.  The space below and above the osseous was opened, and the station R4 nodes were dissected.  Hemostasis was obtained with clips and with electrocautery.  All nodal tissue were sent to Pathology as permanent specimen.  Following this, the chest was thoroughly irrigated and aspirated.  Careful hemostasis was obtained and a couple of air leaks were controlled with #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Then, two #28 French chest tubes were placed in the chest, one posteriorly and one anteriorly, and secured to the skin with #2-0 nylon stitches.  The incision was then closed with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl pericostal stitches.  A running #1 PDS on the muscle layer, a running 2-0 PDS in the subcutaneous tissue, and staples on the skin.

He was placed in the supine position on an OR table.  His arms were carefully taped down.  He was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A 4-cm incision was made obliquely over the left side of his neck.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the platysma.  The platysma was incised using electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was done to create a plane between the strap muscles and the sternoclavicular mastoid muscle.  This allowed us to get right down on to the anterior cervical spine.  Blunt dissection was done to sweep off the longus colli.  We isolated the C7-T1 interspace.  An x-ray was taken to verify; we were indeed at the C7-T1 interspace.,Shadow-Line retractor was placed as well as Caspar pins.  This provided very, very good access to the C7-T1 disk.,At this point, the operating microscope was brought into the decompression.,A thorough and aggressive C7-T1 discectomy was done using a succession of curettes, pituitary rongeur, 4-mm cutting bur and a #2 Kerrison rongeur.  At the end of the discectomy, the cartilaginous endplates were carefully removed using 4-mm cutting burr.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was carefully resected using #2 Kerrison rongeur.

A Gore exclusive device was used 3 pieces were used to effect the repair.  We had to place an iliac extender down in to right external iliac artery to manage the right common iliac artery aneurysm.  The right hypogastric artery had been previously coiled off.  Left common femoral artery was used for the _____ side.  We had small type 2 leak right underneath the take off the renal arteries, this was not felt to be type I leak and this was very delayed filling and it was felt that this was highly indicative of type 2 leak from a lumbar artery, which commonly come off in this area.  It was felt that this would seal after reversal of the anticoagulation given sufficient time.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.,Bilateral groin incisions were made, and the common femoral arteries were dissected out bilaterally.

The patient had a marked dorsal hump, which was both bony and cartilaginous in nature.,2.  The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 months with the second episode 2 weeks following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.

The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.,FINDINGS: , Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline.  The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection.  A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained.  Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed.  The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's.  A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum.  The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples.  The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity.  The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated.  Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum.  All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution.  The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture.  The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips.

She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain.  She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes.  She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.,OPERATIVE COURSE:  , The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail.  She provided her consent.  The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl.  A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure.  This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided.  In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure.  While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse.  In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk.  For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure.  She was noted to have some pools of stool.  This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes.  Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself.  It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum.  However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome.  The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.,PLAN:,  She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures.  She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum.  She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic.

The right frontal area was shaven and then the head was prepped and draped in a standard routine manner.  The area of the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  A curvilinear scalp incision was made extending from just posterior to bregma curving up in the midline and then going off to the right anterior to the coronal suture.  Two Weitlaner were used to hold the scalp open.  A burr hole was made just anterior to the coronal suture and then the dura was opened in a cruciate manner and the pia was coagulated.  Neuropen was introduced directly through the parenchyma into the ventricular system, which was quite large and dilated.  CSF was collected for routine studies.  We saw the total absence of __________  consistent with the congenital form of aqueductal stenosis and a markedly thinned down floor of the third ventricle.  I could bend the ventricular catheter and look back and see the aqueduct, which was quite stenotic with a little bit of chorioplexus near its opening.  The NeuroPEN was then introduced through the midline of the floor of the third ventricle anterior to the mamillary bodies in front of the basilar artery and then was gently enlarged using NeuroPEN __________  various motions.  We went through the membrane of Liliequist.  We could see the basilar artery and the clivus, and there was no significant bleeding from the edges.  The Bactiseal catheter was then left to 7 cm of length because of her macrocephaly and secured to a burr hole port with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.

The patient was started on alpha-blockers with some help, but had nocturia q.1h.  The patient was given anticholinergics with minimal to no help.  The patient had a cystoscopy done, which showed enlargement of the left lateral lobes of the prostate.  At this point, options were discussed such as watchful waiting and laser vaporization to open up the prostate to get a better stream.  Continuation of alpha-blockers and adding another anti-cholinergic at night to prevent bladder overactivity were discussed.  The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder, which can cause poor compliance.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with laser vaporization to see if it would help improve his stream, which in turn might help improve emptying of the bladder and might help his overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was told that he may need anticholinergics.  There could be increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications and the consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder under direct vision.  Bilateral pyelograms were normal.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal except for some moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder.  There was enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate.  The old TUR scar was visualized right at the bladder neck.  Using diode side-firing fiber, the lateral lobes were taken down.  The verumontanum, the external sphincter, and the ureteral openings were all intact at the end of the procedure.  Pictures were taken and were shown to the family.  At the end of the procedure, there was good hemostasis.  A total of about 15 to 20 minutes of lasering time was used.  A #22 3-way catheter was placed.

This operative note will discuss the right total knee arthroplasty.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 cc.,HISTORY:,  This is a 79-year-old female who has disabling bilateral knee degenerative arthritis.  She has been unresponsive to conservative measures.  All risks, complications, anticipated benefits, and postoperative course were discussed.  The patient has agreed to proceed with surgery as described below.,GROSS FINDINGS: , There was noted to be eburnation and wear along the patellofemoral joint and femoral tibial articulation medially and laterally with osteophyte formation and sclerosis.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The Zimmer NexGen total knee system was utilized.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room #2 and placed in supine position on the operating room table.  She was administered spinal anesthetic by Dr. Z.,The tourniquet was placed about the proximal aspect of the right lower extremity.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right lower extremity and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made over the anterior aspect of the right knee.  Subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  A medial parapatellar retinacular incision was made.  The patella was then everted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated.  A drill hole was placed in the distal aspect of the femur and the distal femoral cutting guides were positioned in place.  The appropriate cuts were made at the distal femur as well as with use of the chamfer guide.  The trial femoral component was then positioned in place and noted to have good fit.  Attention was then directed to proximal tibia, the external tibial alignment guide was positioned in place and the proximal tibial cut was made demonstrating satisfactory cut.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments remained intact throughout the procedure as well as the posterior cruciate ligaments.  The remnants of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci were resected.  The tibial trial was positioned in place.  Intraoperative radiographs were taken, demonstrating satisfactory alignment of the tibial cut.  The tibial holes were then drilled.  The patella was then addressed with the Bovie used to remove the soft tissue around the perimeter of the patella.  The patellar cutting guide was positioned in place and the posterior aspect of the patella was resected to the appropriate thickness.  Three drill holes were made within the patella after it was determined that 35 mm patella would be most appropriate.  The knee was placed through range of motion with the trial components marked and then the appropriate components obtained.  The tibial tray was inserted with cement, backed it into place, excess methylmethacrylate was removed.  The femoral component was inserted with methylmethacrylate.  Any excessive methylmethacrylate and bony debris were removed from the joint.  Trial Poly was positioned in place and the knee was held in full extension while the methylmethacrylate became firm.  The methylmethacrylate was also used at the patella.  The prosthesis was positioned in place.  The patellar clamp held securely till the methylmethacrylate was firm.  After all three components were in place, the knee was then again in placed range of motion and there appeared to be some torsion to the proximal tibial component and concerned regarding the alignment.  This component was removed and revised to a stemmed component with better alignment and position.  The previous component removed, the methylmethacrylate was removed.  Further irrigation was performed and then a stemmed template was positioned in place with the intramedullary alignment guide positioned and the tibia drilled and broached.  The trial tibial stemmed component was positioned in place.  Knee was placed through range of motion and the tracking was better.  Actual component was then obtained, methyl methacrylate was placed within the tibia.  The stemmed tibial component was impacted into place with good fit.  The Poly was then positioned in place.  Knee held in full extension with compression longitudinally after methylmethacrylate was solidified.  The trial Poly was removed.  Wound was irrigated and the joint was inspected.  There was no debris.  Collateral ligaments and posterior cruciate ligaments remained intact.  Soft tissue balancing was done and a 17 mm Poly was then inserted with the knee and tibial and femoral components with good tracking as well as the patellar component.  The tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  A drain was placed into the depths of the wound.  The medial retinacular incision was closed with one Ethibond suture in interrupted fashion.  The knee was placed through range of motion and there was no undue tissue tension, good patellar tracking, no excessive soft tissue laxity or constrain.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 undyed Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with surgical clips.  The exterior of the wound was cleansed as well padded dressing ABDs and ace wrap over the right lower extremity.  At the completion of the procedure, distal pulses were intact.  Toes were pink, warm, with good capillary refill.  Distal neurovascular status was intact.  Postoperative x-ray demonstrated satisfactory alignment of the prosthesis.

The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.

The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative care despite multiple attempts at conservative care.  The preoperative discussion with the patient including alternative treatment options, the procedure itself was explained, and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, falling arch, digital contracture, and the postoperative management were discussed.  The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point to interfere with normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was given 1 g Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following a light IV sedation, a posterior tibial nerve block and local infiltrate of the operative site was performed with 10 mL, and a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, and 0.25% Marcaine was affected.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balance anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE:, Plantar fasciotomy, right foot.  The plantar medial tubercle of the calcaneus was palpated and a vertical oblique incision, 2 cm in length with the distal aspect overlying the calcaneal tubercle was affected. Blunt dissection was carried out to expose the deep fascia overlying the abductor hallucis muscle belly and the medial plantar fascial band.  A periosteal elevator did advance laterally across the inferior aspect of the medial and central plantar fascial bands, creating a small and narrow soft tissue tunnel.  Utilizing a Metzenbaum scissor, transection of the medial two-third of the plantar fascia band began at the junction of the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle belly and medial plantar fascial band, extending to the lateral two-thirds of the band.  The lateral plantar fascial band was left intact.  Visualization and finger probe confirmed adequate transection.  The surgical site was flushed with normal saline irrigation.,The deep layer was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted with combination of 1 horizontal mattress and simples.  The dressing consisted of Adaptic, 4 x 4, conforming bandages, and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well, and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact.  A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient will be allowed to be full weightbearing to tolerance, in the boot to encourage physiological lengthening of the release of plantar fascial band.,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Keflex 500 mg 1 p.o. three times a day x10 days and Lortab 5 mg #40, 1 to 2 p.o. q.4-6 h. p.r.n. pain, 2 refills, along with written and oral home instructions.

A time-out process was followed and antibiotics were given.,Then, both legs were prepped and draped in the usual fashion with the patient was in the supine position.  An incision was made in the right groin and the greater saphenous vein at its junction with the femoral vein was dissected out and all branches were ligated and divided.  Then, an incision was made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein was also found and connection to varices from the calf were seen.  A third incision was made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there was a communication with large branch varicosities.  Then, a vein stripper was passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which was divided, was stripped without any difficultly.  Several minutes of compression was used for hemostasis.  Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do.,Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side.  Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there.  The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis.  Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient's position would allow us.  Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples.,Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg.

The patient received 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic on each side.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,Tourniquet time was 53 minutes on the left and 45 minutes on the right.,COMPLICATIONS: , There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS:,  None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HARDWARE USED: , Staple 7/8 inch x1 on each side.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet.  He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Attention was first turned towards the left side.  Intended incision was marked on the skin.  The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view.  The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg.  Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint.  The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally.  Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position.  This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy.  The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction.  This was also checked with fluoroscopy.  The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half.  This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl.  The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril.  Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications.  Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Bilateral long-leg casts were then placed with the foot in neutral with some moulding of his medial plantar arch.  The patient was subsequently was taken to Recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for pain as per parents' request.

She wishes to proceed with arthroplasty at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/11/03.  She was placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated.  The proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed.  Rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide was then placed.  Care was checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a standard distal cut was then taken.  After the cuts were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This was placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment was again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cuts and anterior and posterior cuts were then made as well as the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this was performed, the guide was removed and all bony fragments were then removed.  Attention was then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide was then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care was ensured if it is was a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge was then used to provide us appropriate amount of bony resection.  This was then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractors were used to protect the collateral ligaments and the tip proximal tibial cut was then made.  This bony portion was then removed and remaining meniscal fragments were removed as well as the ACL till adequate exposure was obtained.  Trial components were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial components were then removed.  The tibia was then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate was placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it was stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella was then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade was then used and was taken down, a size 38 patella button was then placed intact.  Again the trial components were placed back into position.  Patella button was placed and the tracking was evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all components were now removed and the knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion was cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement was removed.  The femoral component was then cemented into position.  All excess cement was removed.  A size 12 poly was then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella was then cemented and held into place.  All components were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement was then removed.  The knee was then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this was removed and the size 10 trial was replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragments or osteophytes was performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface was impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee was taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee was once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet was deflated.  Bovie cautery was used to cauterize the knee bleeding that was seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain was then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair was performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This was flexed and the repair was found held securely.  At this point, the knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix rolls was then applied.

A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.,The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL.

When seen in the Emergency Department, he was having no difficulty managing his secretions or any signs of any airway compromise.  Imaging in the Emergency Department did demonstrate an esophageal foreign body at or above the level of the cricopharyngeus.  Due to this, the patient was consented and taken urgently to the operating room for removal of this foreign body.,OPERATIVE DETAILS:,  The patient was correctly identified in the preop holding area and brought to operating room #37.  After informed consent was reviewed, general anesthesia was induced, initially with propofol, the existing IV.  Following this after protective eye tape was placed, #9 Parson's laryngoscope was introduced transorally and used to perform a direct laryngoscopy.  Normal anatomy was visualized.  Following this, a 4-mm, 20-rigid endoscope was introduced through the Parson's laryngoscope and used to perform a direct tracheoscopy.  The patient's supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis down to the level of the mid trachea were found to be benign with no abnormal-appearing anatomy.  Following this, the rigid endoscope was removed and the patient was intubated with a 4-0 endotracheal tube cuffed without difficulty.  After confirming bilateral breath sounds and positive end tidal CO2, this was secured to the patient by the anesthesia staff.  Following this, the Parson's laryngoscope was removed and a size 4 rigid esophagoscope was inserted transorally and passed down to the level of the patient's cricopharyngeus were the foreign body was visualized.  At this point, the coin grasper device was connected to the camera system and inserted through the existing esophagoscope.  This was used to grasp the coin and the coin was removed under direct visualization and handed off as a separate specimen.  Following this, the 34 mm 0-degree scope was inserted through the esophagoscope once the esophagoscope was passed down to the patient's GE junction.  The entire esophageal mucosa was examined as the esophagoscope was backed out and there was only a minimal amount of superficial ulceration in the posterior wall of the esophagus near the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle.

This is secondary to a motor vehicle accident and it was translated appropriately 1 cm.  Risks and benefits have been conferred with the patient as well as the family, they wish to proceed.  The patient was taken to the operating room for a C1-C3 posterior cervical fusion, instrumentation, open reduction and internal fixation.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #5.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated and under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  Spinal cord monitoring was induced.  No changes were seen from the beginning to the end of the case.,Mayfield tongues were placed appropriately.  This was placed in line with the pinna of the ear as well as a cm above the tip of the earlobes.  The patient was subsequently rolled onto the fluoroscopic OSI table in the usual prone position with chest rolls.  The patient's Mayfield tongue was fixated in the usual standard fashion.  The patient was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Midline incision was extended from the base of the skull down to the C4 spinous process.  Full thickness skin fascia developed.  The fascia was incised at midline and the posterior elements at C1, C2, C3, as well as the inferior aspect of the occiput was exposed.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed the level to be C2.,Translaminar screws were placed at C2 bilaterally.  Trajectory was completed with a hand drill and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of pedicles and once this was done, two 3.5 mm translaminar screws were placed bilaterally at C2.  Good placement was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Facet screws were then placed at C3.  Using standard technique of Magerl, starting in the inferomedial quadrant 14 mm trajectories in the 25-degree caudad-cephalad direction as well as 25 degrees in the medial lateral direction was made.  This was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there is no elevation of the trajectory.  A 14 x 3.5 mm screws were then placed appropriately.  Lateral masteries at C1 endplate were placed appropriately.  The medial and lateral borders were demarcated with a Penfield.  The great occipital nerve was retracted out the way.  Starting point was made with a high-speed power bur and midline and lateral mass bilaterally.  Using a 20-degree caudad-cephalad trajectory as well as 10-degree lateral-to-medial direction, the trajectory was completed in 8 mm increments, this was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall of the trajectory.  Once this was done, 24 x 3.5 mm smooth Schanz screws were placed appropriately.  Precontoured titanium rods were then placed between the screws at the C1, C2, C3 and casts were placed appropriately.  Once this was done, all end caps were appropriately torqued.  This completed the open reduction and internal fixation of the C2 fracture, which showed perfect alignment.  It must be noted that the reduction was partially performed on the table using lateral fluoroscopy prior to the instrumentation, almost reducing the posterior vertebral margin of the odontoid fracture with the base of the C2 access.  Once the screws were torqued bilaterally, good alignment was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy, this completed instrumentation as well as open reduction and internal fixation of C2.  The cervical fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements of C1, C2, and C3.  Once this was done, the morselized allograft 30 mL of cortical cancellous bone chips with 10 mL of demineralized bone matrix was placed over the decorticated elements.  The fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl suture figure-of-8.  Superficial drain was placed appropriately.  Good alignment of the instrumentation as well as of the fracture was seen both in the AP and lateral planes.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed using a #2-0 Vicryl suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  The wound was then dressed sterilely using Bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape, and the drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was subsequently released with a Mayfield contraption and rolled on to the stretcher in the usual supine position.  Mayfield tongues were subsequently released.

Application of short leg splint.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY: , This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal.  The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot.  She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain.  She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y.  The consent is available on the chart for review.  The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected.  Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base.  The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal.  An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized.  The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial.  There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view.  A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve.  A linear incision was created with a #10 blade.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached.  Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade.  Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone.  The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus.  A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy.  The fracture site was easily found.  An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis.,A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone.  Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone.  Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone.  Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced.  Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally.  A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly.  All this was done under fluoroscopy.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The fracture site was found to have rigid compression.  The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique.  A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance.  A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied.,A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied.  The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone.

She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms.  For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic.  She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected.  Second check was made prior to prepping and draping.  Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level.  We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars.  We dissected down carefully to identify the pars.  We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level.  We did this under live fluoroscopy.  We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well.  We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars.  The pars was then drilled out.  We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord.  We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty.  Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further.  Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well.  We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily.  We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material.  We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root.  The Epstein curette removed some more disc material.  Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression.  We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure.  We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure.  Hemostasis was meticulous.  The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied.  Dressing was applied.

Laparoscopically, the patient has massive pelvic adhesions with completely obliterated posterior cul-de-sac and adnexa.,No adnexal structures were initially able to be visualized until after the lysis of adhesions.  Eventually we found a normal appearing right ovary, severely scarred right and left fallopian tubes, and a enlarged complex cystic left ovary.  There was a normal-appearing appendix and liver, and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limits.  There were significant adhesions from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterus.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina was elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 12 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank.  Next a Telfa pad was placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage was performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue.  Next, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Small amount of normal saline was injected into Veress needle and seemed to drop freely.  So, the Veress needle was connected to he CO2 gas, which was started at the lower setting.  It was seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas was advanced to the higher setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was inserted.  Next, the introducer was removed from the trocar and the laparoscope was inserted through this port and the port was also connected to the CO2 gas.  At this point, the initial operative findings were seen.  Next, a size #5 step trocar was inserted approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis in the midline.  This was done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife, introducing a Veress needle with Ethicon sheet, and the Veress needle was then removed and the #5 port was introduced under direct visualization.  A size #5 port was also placed approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus in a similar manner also under direct visualization.  A blunt probe was inserted suprapubically along with a grasper in the right upper quadrant.  These were used to see the above operative findings.  Next, a size #12 mm port was introduced approximately seven fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus under direct visualization.  Through this, a Harmonic scalpel was inserted.,The Harmonic scalpel along with the grasper was used to meticulously address the adhesions along the right adnexa in the posterior cul-de-sac.  Care was taken at all times to avoid the bowel and the ureters.  The fallopian tubes appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease.  After the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior cul-de-sac was clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligaments.  Attention was turned to the left adnexa, which appeared to contain a cystic structure, but it was unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure was.  Adhesions were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary, and sidewall.  The adhesions were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the Harmonic scalpel.  At intermittent points throughout the procedure, the suction irrigator was used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel was removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was inserted and this was used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure.  Next, the needle was removed and the ligature device was inserted.  This was used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube was ligated, the uterovarian ligament was clamped and ligated with the ligature device.  Next, the fallopian tube was removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligations.  Then, the attention was turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary.  First the infundibulopelvic ligament was identified, clamped with a ligature device, and ligated.  Next, the ovary was bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter.  Next, the ligature device was used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across.  Then the ovary was completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis.  This was grasped with a clamp.  The ligature device was removed from the #12 and a EndoCatch bag was inserted to the size #12 port.  The left ovary was placed in this EndoCatch bag, which was then removed along with the whole port from the left upper quadrant.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated and suctioned of all blood and extra fluid.  At this point, the remaining two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was desufflated.  Next, an introducer was replaced on a #11 port.  The #11 port was removed.  Next, the fascia in the left upper quadrant port was identified and grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and closed with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl on a UR-6 needle.  Next, all skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were cleaned, injected with 0.25% Marcaine, and then adjusted with Steri-Strips and bandage appropriately.,The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition and should be observed overnight in the hospital.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This subsequently became infected.  She has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer.  She currently presents for stage II reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  A Foley catheter was inserted.  A formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site.  Preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures.  The patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up.  The previous surgical incision was identified.  The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent.  Immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue.  Dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue.  Soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring.  There was no native tissue to orient oneself with.  We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer.  We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter.  Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed.  This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection.  The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur.  Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum.  A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure.  Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur.  This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum.  The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue.  This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie.  Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed.  Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell.  The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit.  Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur.  The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes.  Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal.  The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place.  Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur.  This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods.  The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem.  The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial.  The body was too tight proximally to fit.  The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body.  A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled.  This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill.  Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position.  Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur.  The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed.  Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly.  We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner.  Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly.  This was due to reversion of the femoral component.  As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion.  The stem was extracted and retrialed.  Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components.  A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell.  The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal.  Again, the hip was trialed.  The components were found to be in relative retroversion.  The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted.  Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion.  Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts.  The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated.  It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing.  Decision was made to accept the component position.  The real femoral head was selected and implanted.  The hip was then taken again to a range of motion.  It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation.  The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly.,The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage.  Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure.,The wound was then closed in a layered fashion.  A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin.  An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well.

An ultrasound suggestive with a mass of 8 cm, did not respond to suppression with norethindrone acetate and on repeat ultrasound following the medical treatment, the ovarian neoplasm persisted and did not decreased in size.,PROCEDURE:  ,Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in lithotomy position, prepped and draped.  A low transverse incision was made down to and through to the rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was put laterally.  The inferior epigastric arteries were identified bilaterally, doubly clamped and tied with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The rectus muscle was then split transversally and the peritoneum was split transversally as well.  The left adnexal mass was identified and large bowel was attached to the mass and Dr. Zuba from General Surgery dissected the large bowel adhesions and separated them from the adnexal mass.  The ureter was then traced and found to be free of the mass and free of the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated, entered via blunt dissection.  A #0 Vicryl suture was put into place, doubly clamped with curved Heaney clamps, cut with curved Mayo scissors and #0 Vicryl fixation suture put into place.  Curved Heaney clamps were then used to remove the remaining portion of the ovary from its attachment to the uterus and then #0 Vicryl suture was put into place.  Pathology was called to evaluate the mass for potential malignancy and the pathology's verbal report at the time of surgery was that this was a benign lesion.  Irrigation was used.  Minimal blood loss at the time of surgery was noted.  Sigmoid colon was inspected in place in physiologic position of the cul-de-sac as well as small bowel omentum.  Instrument, needle, and sponge counts were called for and found to be correct.  The peritoneum was closed with #0 Vicryl continuous running locking suture.

Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures.

Chest x-ray and CT scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening.  A biopsy was performed at an outside hospital (Kaiser) and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma.  The patient had a metastatic workup, which was negative including a brain MRI and bone scan.  The bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor.  The patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease, hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, longstanding atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  He and his family were apprised of the high-risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  The patient was intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  A Foley catheter was placed.  The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib.  A thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space.  Inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions, which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  The thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly.  It was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor, approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected.  The ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect.  The ribs 7, 8, 9, and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips.  The chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly.  It was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement.  Inferiorly, the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor.  The spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected.  Inferiorly, the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace.  The dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine.  The left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the GIA 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe, which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung.  A 2-0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection.  Posteriorly, the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately T8 and T9, where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies.  The ribs were disarticulated, closed to or at their articulations with the spine.  Bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery.  There was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta.,The posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section.  The specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figure-of-8 #1 Ethibond sutures.  This produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension.  A single 32-French chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly.  This was secured with a #1 silk suture.  The Gore-Tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect.  A series of #1 Prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually.  The resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate.  The serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure-of-8 0 Vicryl.  The latissimus was reapproximated with a two #1 Vicryl placed in running fashion.  Of note, two #10 JP drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 3-0 Vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were dressed.  The patient was brought from the operating room directly to the North ICU, intubated in stable condition.

The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes.  An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus.  Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels.  An elevator was used to expose the fracture.  The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp.  An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase.  The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction.  A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally.  Excellent stability of fracture was achieved.  Final fluoroscopy showed a reduction to be anatomic in 2 planes.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  Deep tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and closed with staples.  Dry sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure, was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

He has had a history of similar onset.  Apparently, he had no full on one ultrasound and full on a second ultrasound, but because of possible torsion, detorsion, or incomplete detorsion, I recommended an exploration.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was placed in supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered.  The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity.  There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord.  The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created.  The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation.  No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used.  The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  Again, an appendix testis was cauterized.  No torsion was seen.  He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture.  The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% Marcaine.  The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Placement of VAC negative pressure wound dressing.,INDICATIONS: , This 3-year-old male suffered amputation of his left upper extremity with complications of injury.  He presents at this time for further attempts at closure.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , A clean wound to left upper extremity with partial dehiscence of previously closed wounds and also the closure was satisfactory.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under inhalational anesthesia, he was prepped and draped in usual fashion exposing left upper extremity and also exposing continuity of the left abdomen, chest, and groin.  He underwent systematic evaluation of his wound of his left upper extremity and we excised first the whole wound prior to doing some additional closure.  Some areas were dehisced and appeared to be because it was approximation of granulation tissue and as a result the edges were freshened up prior to approximating them.  In this fashion, simple closure was accomplished and its total length was approximately 8 cm.  It should be noted that prior to doing any procedure that appropriate timeout was performed and he received prophylactic antibiotics as indicated and did not require DVT prophylaxis.  At this time, once we accomplished debridement and simple closure removing skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle and bone as well as closing the arm, we could design our flap for the abdomen.  The flap was designed as a slightly greater than 1:1 ellipse of skin from just below the costal margin.  This was elevated at the level of the external oblique and then laid on the left forearm.  The donor's site was closed using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl in the deep dermis and running subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl on the skin.  Steri-Strips were applied.  At this time, the flap was inset using again 4-0 Monocryl sutures and then ultimately the VAC negative pressure wound dressing was applied to help hold this in place and optimize the vascularization of the flap.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant mass of the left neck.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Malignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURES,1.  Left neck mass biopsy.,2.  Selective surgical neck dissection, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room.  Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.,Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap.  Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.,Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass.  The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck.  A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section.  At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen.  Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements.  This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface.  There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated.  At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.,With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck.  This worked out quite nicely.  The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it.  We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A.  When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise.  Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged.  At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.,The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination.  Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen.  Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate.  The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap.  The flap was replaced in its position.  A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated.  It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it.  A pressure dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The chest was prepped and draped in the routine fashion for insertion of a Port-A-Catheter.  The left subclavian vein was punctured with a single stick and a guidewire threaded through the needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was removed.  An incision was made over the guidewire for entrance of the dilator with sheath.  A second counter incision was made transversally on the chest wall about an inch and half below the puncture site with a #15 blade.  Hemostasis was effective to electrocautery, and a pocket was fashioned subcutaneously for positioning of the reservoir.  The Port-A-Catheter reservoir tubing was attached to the reservoir in the routine fashion.  The reservoir was placed in the pocket and sutured to the anterior chest wall muscle with three interrupted 4-0 Prolene sutures for stability.  Next, a catheter passer was passed from the pocket exiting through the skin at the puncture site, previously placed for the guidewire, and the Port-A-Catheter was pulled from the reservoir exiting on the skin.  It was placed on the chest, measured, and cut to the appropriate length.  This having been done, the dilator with sheath attached was passed over the guidewire into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire and dilator were removed, and the Port-A-Catheter was threaded through the sheath into the superior vena cava, and the sheath removed under fluoroscopic guidance.  Fluoroscopy revealed the Port-A-Catheter to be in excellent position.  The Port-A-Catheter was accessed with a butterfly 90-degree needle percutaneously that drew blood well and flushed easily.  It was flushed with heparinized saline connected in cath.  This having been done, the puncture site was closed with a circumferential subcutaneous 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with a percutaneous circumferential subcuticular suture.  This having been done, attention was applied to the reservoir incision.  It was closed with two layers of continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with a continuous 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch.

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.

An orogastric was placed and a Foley catheter placed.  He was placed in a modified flank position with the hips rotated to 45 degrees.  Pillow was used to prevent any pressure points.  He was widely shaved, prepped, and draped.  A marking pen was used to delineate a site for the Pneumo sleeve in the right lower quadrant and for the trocar sites in the midline just above the umbilicus and halfway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus.  The incision was made through the premarked site through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The aponeurosis of the external oblique was incised in the direction of its fibers.  Muscle-splitting incision was made in the internal oblique and transversus abdominis.  The peritoneum was opened and the Pneumo sleeve was placed in the usual fashion being sure that no bowel was trapped inside the ring.  Then, abdominal insufflation was carried out through the Pneumo sleeve and the scope was passed through the Pneumo sleeve to visualize placement of the trocars in the other two positions.  Once this had been completed, the scope was placed in the usual port and dissection begun by taking down the white line of Toldt, so that the colon could be retracted medially.  This exposed the duodenum, which was gently swept off the inferior vena cava and dissection easily disclosed the takeoff of the right renal vein off the cava.  Next, attention was directed inferiorly and the ureter was divided between clips and the inferior tongue of Gerota fascia was taken down, so that the psoas muscle was exposed.  The attachments lateral to the kidney was taken down, so that the kidney could be flipped anteriorly and medially, and this helped in exposing the renal artery.  The renal artery had been previously noticed on the CT scan to branch early and so each branch was separately ligated and divided using the stapler device.  After the arteries had been divided, the renal vein was divided again using a stapling device.  The remaining attachments superior to the kidney were divided with the Harmonic scalpel and also utilized the stapler, and the specimen was removed.  Reexamination of the renal fossa at low pressures showed a minimal degree of oozing from the adrenal gland, which was controlled with Surgicel.  Next, the port sites were closed with 0 Vicryl utilizing the passer and doing it over the hand to prevent injury to the bowel and the right lower quadrant incision for the hand port was closed in the usual fashion.

Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2.  Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:,  None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.  Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided.  The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia.

The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity.  The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  Tourniquet time was 74 minutes.  A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated.  The _________ was identified.  It was incised.  The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found.  There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture.  This area was suctioned clean.  The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon.  Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture.  Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously.  The radial tuberosity was palpated.  Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow.  A skin incision was made over this area.  Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split.,A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa.  The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision.  At this point, they were placed to the side.  Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated.  The tuberosity came into view.  The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection.  Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity.  Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture.  The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole.  The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated.  The suture was tied over the bone islands.  Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples.  The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples.  Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia.  A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position.  Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint.  Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately.  The patient was awakened.

This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.

The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.

She requested appendectomy because of the concern of future diagnostic dilemma with pain crisis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were recommended to her.  The procedure was explained in detail including the risks of bleeding, infection, biliary injury, retained common duct stones.  After answering her questions, she wished to proceed and gave informed consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed.  After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped.,The infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created.  The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity.  Upper abdominal anatomy was normal.  Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings.  Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____.  There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region.  Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad.  Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction.  A small ductotomy was created.  Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated.  Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material.  This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction.  There was no evidence of common bile duct stones.  The cholangiogram catheter was removed.  The duct was doubly clipped and divided.  The artery was divided and cauterized.  The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa.  It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen.  Attention was then paid to the appendix.  The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base.  This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler.  The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler.  This was placed in another Endocatch bag.  The abdomen was then irrigated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  Both the appendix and gallbladder were removed and sent for pathology.  All trocars were removed.

The patient has a history of chronic ulceration to the right foot which has been treated on an outpatient basis with conservative methods Dr. X.  At this time, he desires surgical correction as the ulcer has been refractory to conservative treatment.  Incidentally, the ulcer is noninfective and practically healed at this date.  The consent is available on the chart for review and Dr. X has discussed the risks versus benefits of this procedure to the patient in detail.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across his waist for his protection.  A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right foot over copious amount of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were administered into the right fifth metatarsal using a Mayo type block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operating field and a sterile stockinet was reflected.  The Betadine was cleansed with saline-soaked gauze and dried.  Anesthesia was tested with a one tooth pickup and found to be adequate.  A #10 blade was used to make 3.5 cm linear incision over the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  Care was taken to retract the extensor digitorum longus tendon medially and the abductor digiti minimi tendon laterally.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the medial and lateral edges of the wound were undermined down to the level of the capsule and deep fascia.  A linear capsular incision was made with a #15 blade down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade.  Metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  There was hypertrophic exostosis noted laterally as well as a large bursa in the subcuteneous tissue layer.  The ulcer on the skin was approximately 2 x 2 mm, it was partial skin thickness and did not probe.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the hypertrophic lateral eminence.  The hypertrophic bone was split in half and one half was sent to Pathology and the other half was sent to Microbiology for culture and sensitivity.  Next, a reciprocating rasp was used to smoothen all bony surfaces.  The bone stock had an excellent healthy appearance and did not appear to be infected.  Copious amount of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline were used to flush the wound.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress suture technique.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Betadine-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Kling.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  He was given a postop shoe and will be full weightbearing.  He has prescription already at home for hydrocodone and does not need to refill.  He is to follow up with Dr. X and was given emergency contact numbers.

Suppression was attempted, however, unsuccessful.  She presents today with her thyroid goiter.  A thyroidectomy was indicated at this time secondary to the patient's chronic condition.  Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and details of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history was reviewed and physical examinations was evaluated.  The patient was brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine was infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade was then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection was carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma was identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane was created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral directions using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscles were identified.  The midline raphe was not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision was made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection was carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It was noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection was utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia as well as strap muscles off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This was carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule was then identified.  A hemostat was placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was placed in this area.  A second Kitner was placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid was retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection was then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessels and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This was carried out until the superior pole was identified.  Careful attention was made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection was then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid was then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve was then identified and tracked to its insertion.  The overlying vessels of the middle thyroid vein as well as the associated structures were then identified and great attention was made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it was completed, this lobule was then removed from Berry's ligament.  There was noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule was then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention was then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were already separated.  Army-Navy as well as femoral retractors were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein was identified.  Blunt dissection was carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat was utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was then placed in this area.  Another Kitner was placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection was utilized to identify the appropriate structures in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature as well as bipolar cautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention was made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole was then freed appropriately and blunt dissection was carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect was then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid was then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve has been identified.  A careful dissection was then carried out to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side as close to the thyroid gland as possible.  The thyroid was then removed from the Berry's ligament and it was then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This was irrigated and pinpoint areas were bipolored as necessary.  Surgicel was then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscles as well as the appropriate fascial attachments were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma was identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane was approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture was then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 was then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze was then placed.  The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

She was found to have a visually-significant cataract and, after discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery, she elected to proceed with cataract extraction and lens implantation in this eye in efforts to improve her vision.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified in the preoperative holding area and the informed consent was reviewed and verified to be on the chart.  They were transported to the operative suite, accompanied by the anesthesia service, where appropriate cardiopulmonary monitoring was established.  MAC anesthesia was achieved, which was followed by topical anesthesia using 1% preservative-free tetracaine eye drops.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for sterile ophthalmic surgery and a lid speculum was placed.,Two stab-incision paracenteses were made in the cornea using the MVR blade, and the anterior chamber was irrigated with 1% preservative-free lidocaine for intracameral anesthesia.  The anterior chamber was filled with viscoelastic and a shelved, temporal, clear corneal incision was made using the diamond groove knife and steel keratome.  A continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis was made in the anterior capsule using the bent-needle cystotome.  The lens nucleus was hydrodissected and hydrodelineated using balanced saline solution (BSS) on a Chang cannula until it rotated freely.,The phacoemulsification handpiece was introduced into the anterior chamber, and the lens nucleus was sculpted into 2 halves.  Each half was further subdivided with chopping and removed with phacoemulsification.  The remaining cortical material was removed with the irrigation and aspiration (I&A) handpiece.  The capsular bag was inflated with viscoelastic and the intraocular lens was injected into the capsule without difficulty.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed with the I&A handpiece, and the anterior chamber was filled to an appropriate intraocular pressure with BSS.  The corneal wounds were hydrated and verified to be water-tight.  Antibiotic ointment was placed, followed by a patch and shield.  The patient was transported to the PACU in good/stable condition.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed.

Kocher Langenbeck variety incision was utilized and carried down through the fascia lata with the split fibers of the gluteus maximus in line.  The femoral insertion of gluteus maximus was tenotomized close to its femoral insertion.  The piriformis and obturator internus tendons and adjacent gemelli were tenotomized close to their femoral insertion, tagged, and retractor was placed in the lesser notch as well as a malleable retractor in the greater notch enabling the exposure of the posterior column.  The major transverse fracture was freed of infolded soft tissue, clotted blood, and lavaged copiously with sterile saline solution and then reduced anatomically with the aid of bone hook in the notch and provisionally stabilized utilizing a tenaculum clamp and definitively stabilized utilizing a 7-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plate with the montage including two interfragmentary screws.  It should be mentioned that prior to reduction and stabilization of the acetabular fracture its femoral head component was removed from the joint enabling direct visualization of the articular surface.  Once a stable fixation of the reduced fracture of the acetabulum was accomplished, it should be mentioned that in the process of doing this, the posterior wall fragment was hinged on its soft tissue attachments and a capsulotomy was made in the capsule in line with the rent at the level of the posterior wall.  Once this was accomplished, the procedure was turned over to Dr. X and his team, who proceeded with placement of cup and femoral components as well and cup was preceded by placement of a trabecular metal tray for the cup with screw fixation of same.

A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation.  He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process.  He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.,I met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options.  All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion.  We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure.  A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia.  CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.,There was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum.  After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix.  In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix.  The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port.  I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system.  When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible.  The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.

An approximately 6 cm dorsal medial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated with hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue were then undermined off of the capsule medially.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The periosteum and capsule were then reflected off of the first metatarsal.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  The articular cartilage was healthy for patient's age and race.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed..  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was carried out until the adductor tendon insertions were identified.  The adductor tendons were transected as well as a lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor hallucis longus to make sure that tendon that was transected was the extensor hallucis brevis at the _______ digitorum.  Extensor hallucis brevis tendon was transected and care was taken to preserve the extensor halucis longus tendon.  Attention was then directed to medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Sagittal was then used to create a long dorsal arm outside the Austin type osteotomy and the first metatarsal.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally until correction of the intermetatarsal angle was noted.  The head was intact.  A 0.45 K-wire was inserted through subcutaneously from proximal medial to distal lateral.  A second K-wire was then inserted from distal lateral to proximal plantar medial.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site.  The K-wires were bent, cut, and pin caps were placed.  Attention was then directed to the proximal phalanx of the hallux.  The capsular periostem was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal was then used to create an akin osteotomy closing wedge.  The apex was lateral and the base of the wedge was medial.  The wedge was removed in the total and the osteotomy site was then feathered until closure was achieved without compression.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted, one from distal medial to proximal lateral and the second from distal lateral to proximal medial across the osteotomy site.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site and the osteotomy was closed.  The toe was noted to be in a markedly more rectus position.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining prominent medial eminence.  The area was then smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  There was noted to be a small osteophytic formation laterally over first metatarsal head that was removed with a rongeur and smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  The area was then inspected for any remaining short bony edges, none were noted.,Copious amounts of sterile saline was then used to flush the surgical site.  The capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl.

There has been a progressive and gradual decline in the visual acuity.  By examination, this was found to be related to cataracts.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives (including observation or spectacles) were discussed in detail.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained.,Questions were answered in personal conference with the patient to ensure that the patient had a good grasp of the operative goals, risks, and alternatives involved as well as the postoperative instructions.  A preoperative surgical history and physical examination was done to ensure that the patient was in optimal general health for cataract surgery.  To minimize and decrease the chance of bacterial infection, the patient was started on a course of antibiotic drops for two days prior to surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a comfortable supine position.  The operative table was placed in Trendelenburg head-up tilt to decrease orbital congestion and posterior vitreous pressure.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  The lids and periorbita were prepped with full-strength Betadine solution with care taken to concentrate on sterilizing the eyelid margins.  The conjunctival cul-de-sac was also prepped in dilute Betadine solution.  The fornices were also prepped.  The drape was done meticulously to ensure complete eyelash inclusion.,An eyelid speculum was placed to separate the eyelids.  A paracentesis site was made.  Intracameral preservative-free lidocaine was injected.  Amvisc Plus was then used to stabilize the anterior chamber.  A 3-mm diamond blade was then used to carefully construct a clear corneal incision in the temporal location.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome was used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsular flap was removed.  A 27-gauge blunt cannula was used for hydrodissection.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer technique was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove remaining cortex with the I/A handpiece.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  The intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag.  The lens was then dialed into position.  The lens was well-centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure along with stromal hydration.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and well-centered intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Zymar and Pred Forte drops were applied.  A firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.

Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made.  Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps.  A bladed 11-mm port was inserted without difficulty.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02.  Under direct vision 2 additional, non-bladed, 11-mm trocars were placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant.  There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel.  The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve.  This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice.  The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal.  The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye.  There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp.  The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely. The specimen was then removed through the 12-mm port and examined on the back table.  The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear.  I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon.  This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined.  There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear.  The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution.  There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery.  The trocars were removed under direct vision.  No bleeding was noted.  The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure-of-eight O Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were closed with running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing.

Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.  The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal.  The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach.  The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer.  The trial components were positioned into place.  The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head.  Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion.  There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction.  There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.

The patient did receive Ancef.,INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: , This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago.  The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient.  Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure.  He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure.  Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region.  The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors.  This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord.  With this accomplished, the testis was then identified.  It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.,The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord.  Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens.  Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure.  There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis.  Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment.  This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment.  Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision.  A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment.  Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors.  A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision.  A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord.  With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis.  The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy.  The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures.  Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures.  External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad.  Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord.  There appeared to be no evidence of compression.  Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin.  Finally, the patient was cleansed.,The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum.

Cystoscopy with left ureteral stent.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old gentleman who had a previous perforated diverticula.  Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder.  Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra.  The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley.  At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.,The incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline.  Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall.  Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall.  Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis.  At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats.  The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made.  First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well.  Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound.  Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired.  The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied.  Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum.  The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it.  The EEA was then fired.  Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid.  Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis.  A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis.  Colonoscope was introduced.  No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Pictures of the anastomosis were taken.  The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum.  Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed.  First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture.  The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle.  Subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin.,The iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well.

Bilateral orbital advancement with (C-shaped osteotomies down to the inferior orbital rim) with bilateral orbital advancement with bone grafts.,3.  Bilateral forehead reconstruction with autologous graft.,4.  Advancement of the temporalis muscle bilaterally.,5.  Barrel-stave osteotomies of the parietal bones.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with a roll under his shoulders and his head resting on a foam doughnut.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped with ChloraPrep.  Incision was infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and he received antibiotics and he was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A bicoronal zigzag incision was made and Raney clips used for hemostasis.  Subcutaneous flaps were developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  These were subgaleal flaps.  Bipolar and Bovie cautery were used for hemostasis.  The craniectomy was outlined with methylene blue.  The pericranium was incised exposing the bone along the outline of the craniotomy.,Paired bur holes were drilled anteriorly and posteriorly straddling the metopic suture.  One was just above the nasion and the other was near the bregma.  Also bilateral pterional bur holes were drilled.  There was a little bit of bleeding from a tributary of the sagittal sinus anteriorly and so bone wax was used for hemostasis in all the bur holes.,The dura was separated with a #4 Penfield dissector and then the craniotomies were fashioned or cut.  I should say with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit and the footplate attachment, the bilateral craniotomies were cut and then the midline piece was elevated separately.  Great care was taken when removing the bone from the midline.  Bipolar cautery was used for bleeding points on the dura and especially over the sagittal sinus and the bleeding was controlled.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,The next step was to perform the orbital osteotomies with careful protection of the orbital contents.  Osteotomies were made with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit in the orbital roof bilaterally.  This was a very thick and vertically oriented orbital roof on each side.  Midas Rex drill and osteotomes and mallet were used to cut these osteotomies using retractors to protect the orbital contents and the dura.  The osteotomies were carried down through the tripod of the orbit and down through the lateral orbital rim and all the way down to the inferior orbital rim using the osteotome and mallet.  Bone wax was used for hemostasis.  It was necessary to score the undersurface of the bone at the midline because it was so thick and pointed.  So we were not going to be able to effect the orbital advancement without scoring the bone and thinning it out a bit.  This was done with the Midas Rex drill using B5 bit.  Also, the marked ridge just above the nasion was burred down with the Midas Rex drill.  The osteotomies were also carried down through the zygoma.  At this point, with a gentle rocking motion and sustained pressure using the osteotomes, it was then possible to carefully advance the orbital rims bilaterally, first on the right and then on the left again using just a careful rocking motion against the remaining bone to gently bend the orbital rims outward bilaterally.,Dr. X cut the bone grafts from the bone flaps and I fashioned a shelf to secure the bone graft by burring a ledge on the internal surface of the superior orbital rim.  This created a shelf for the notched bone graft to lean against basically anteriorly.  The posterior notch of the bone graft was able to be braced by the ledge of orbital roof posteriorly.,The left medial orbital rim greenstick fractured a bit, but the bone graft appeared to stay in place.,Holes were then cut in the supraorbital rim for advancement of the temporalis muscle and then a Synthes mesh was placed anteriorly using absorbable screw hardware and attached the mesh where the forehead bone flaps turned around and recontoured to make a nice bilateral forehead for Isaac.,At this point the undersurface of the temporalis muscle was scored using the Bovie cautery to allow advancement of the muscle anteriorly and we sutured it to the supraorbital rims bilaterally with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  This helped fill-in the indentation left by the orbital advancement at the temporal region.,Also, I separated the undersurface of the dura from the bone bilaterally and cut multiple barrel-stave osteotomies in the parietal bones and then greenstick fractured these barrel-staves outward to create a more normal contour of the bone slightly posteriorly.,At this point, Gelfoam had been used to protect the dura over the sagittal sinus during this part of the procedure.,The wound was then irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  Bleeding had been controlled during the procedure with Bovie and bipolar electrocautery, even so the blood loss was fairly significant adding up to about 300 or 400 mL and he received that much in packed cells and he also received a unit of fresh frozen plasma.,At this point, the reconstruction looked good.  The advancement was about 1 cm and we were pleased with the results.  The wound was irrigated and then the Gelfoam over the midline dura was left in place and the galea was then closed with #4-0 and some #3-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and #5-0 mild chromic on the skin.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.

He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.

The images were transmitted to the computer system for radiation oncologist to determine the dosing etc.  Based on the computer analysis, the grid was placed.  Careful attention was drawn to keep the grid away from the patient.  There was a centimeter distance between the skin and the grid.  Under ultrasound guidance, the needles were placed, first in the periphery of the prostate, a total of 63 seeds were placed throughout the prostate.  A total of 24 needles was used.  Careful attention was drawn to stay away from the urethra.  Under longitudinal ultrasound guidance, all the seeds were placed.  There were no seeds visualized in the bladder under ultrasound.  There was only one needle where the seeds kind of dragged as the needle was coming out on the left side and were dropped out of position.  Other than that, all the seeds were very well distributed throughout the prostate under fluoroscopy.  Please note that the Foley catheter was in place throughout the procedure.  Prior to the seed placement, the Foley was attempted to be placed, but we had to do it using a Glidewire to get the Foley in and we used a Councill-tip catheter.  The patient has had history of bulbar urethral stricture.  Pictures were taken of the strictures in the pre-seed placement cysto time frame.  We needed to do the cystoscopy and Glidewire to be able to get the Foley catheter in.  At the end of the procedure, again cystoscopy was done, the entire bladder was visualized.  The stricture was wide open.  The prostate was slightly enlarged.  The bladder appeared normal.  There was no sheath inside the urethra or in the bladder.  The cysto was done using 30-degree and 70-degree lens.  At the end of the procedure, a Glidewire was placed, and 18 Councill-tip catheter was placed.  The plan was for Foley to be left in place overnight since the patient has history of urethral strictures.  The patient is to follow up tomorrow to have the Foley removed.  The patient could also be shown to have it removed at home.,The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition at the end of the procedure.

There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele.  On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each.  The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure.  The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics.  Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed.  The patient was interested in the trial.  The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.  The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed.,Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in prone position.  A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up.  The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues.  The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen.  Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed.  The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature.  The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area.  The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation.  There was no sensation down the leg.  The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle.  A wire was placed.  The tract was dilated and lead was placed.  The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position.  Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation.  Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks.  Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling.  A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead.  Screws were turned and they were dropped.  Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim.  Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch.  Impedance was checked.  Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution.  The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The pouch was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 Monocryl.

The patient was seen in the emergency room.  The patient had a complete fracture of both bones with shortening bayonet apposition.  Treatment options were offered to the family including casting versus closed reduction and pinning.  The parents opted for the latter.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery included risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, cast tightness.  All questions were answered, and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A small incision was made at the tip of the olecranon.  Initially, a 1.11 guidewire was placed, but this was noted to be too wide for this canal.  This was changed for a 0.79 K-wire.  This was driven up to the fracture site.  The fracture was manually reduced and then the K-wire passed through the distal segment.  This demonstrated adequate fixation and reduction of both bones.  The pin was then cut short.  The fracture site and pin site was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The incision was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were cleaned and dried.  Dressed with Xeroform, 4 x 4.  The patient was then placed in a well-moulded long-arm cast.  He tolerated the procedure well.

The patient underwent a Bier block by the Department of Anesthesia on the upper extremity.  The upper extremity was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and left free.  Attention was drawn then to the palm of the hand.  We did identify area of incision that we would make, which was located over the carpal tunnel.,Approximately, 1.5 cm incision was made using a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was carried through the skin and fascia over the palm down to the carpal tunnel taking care during dissection to avoid any branches of nerves.  Carpal tunnel was then entered and the rest of the transverse carpal ligament was incised sharply with a #10 scalpel.  We inspected the median nerve and found that it was flat and compressed from the transverse carpal ligament.  We found no evidence of tumor or space occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel.  We then irrigated copiously.  Tourniquet was taken down at that time and pressure was held.  There was no evidence of obvious bleeders.

The adhesion was taken down, and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion was sent for pathologic analysis.  The final frozen pathology on this entire area returned as negative for tumor.  Additional chest wall abnormalities were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis, and these all returned separately as negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue.  Several other biopsies were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall.  All of the biopsy sites were additionally marked with Hemoclips.  The right middle lobe lesion was accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY: , Stable.,HISTORY OF PROCEDURE:,  This patient is well known to our service.  He was admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control.  The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on April 4, 2007, was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident.  Although, he had markedly difficult airway, the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi.  No abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree, and based on this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was kept in the supine position, and the single-lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double-lumen tube was placed.  Following this, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded.  Sterile DuraPrep preparation on the right chest was placed.  A sterile drape around that was also placed.  The table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces.  A second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision.  The incisions for the VATS right middle lobectomy included a small 1-cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula.  The camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5-mm 30-degree scope was used.  Third incision was an anterior port, which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space, and the third incision was a utility port, which was a 4 cm long incision, which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein.  All of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure.  The initial incision was the camera port through which, under direct visualization, an additional small 5-mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port.  These two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions, which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions.  Multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken, and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port.  Through these three incisions, the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed.  Multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative.  The right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall.  This area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis.  This also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue, but no tumor cells.  Based on this, the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy.  Following this, the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed.  The middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45-mm EndoGIA stapler.  Following division of the right superior pulmonary vein, the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified.  Initially, this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus, but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45-mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the pulmonary artery was easily identified.  Two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe.  These were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp.  The vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk, and following this, an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe.  A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe.  Following complete division of the fissure, the lobe was put into an EndoGIA bag and taken out through the utility port.  Following removal of the right middle lobe, a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4R area as well as the 7 lymph node package.  Node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified, therefore none were taken.  The patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted.  A 19-French Blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32-French chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position.  Following this, the patient's lung was allowed to reexpand fully, and the patient was checked for air leaking once again.  Following this, all the ports were closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue, and 3-0 Vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.

Repair of deltoid ligament.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 90 min.,BLOOD LOSS:,  50 cc.,The patient is in the semilateral position on the beanbag.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  A comminuted Hawkins IV talus fracture with an incomplete rupture of the deltoid ligament.  There was no evidence of osteochondral defects of the talar dome.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  There was no open injury.  The patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  There was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle.,It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the above-named procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought back to operative room #4 of ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/03.  A spinal anesthetic was administered.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  He was then positioned on the beanbag.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, an anteromedial incision was made in order to perform a medial malleolus osteotomy to best localize the fracture region in order to be able to bone graft the comminuted fracture site.  At this time, a #15 blade was used to make approximately 10 cm incision over the medial malleolus.  This was curved anteromedial along the root of the saphenous vein.  The saphenous vein was located.  Its tributaries going plantar were cauterized and the vein was retracted anterolaterally.  At this time, we identified the medial malleolus.  There was evidence of approximately 80% avulsion, rupture of the deltoid ligament off of the medial malleolus.  This was a major blood feeder to the medial malleolus and we were concerned, once we were going to do the osteotomy, that this would later create healing problem.  It is for this reason that the pedicle, which was attached to the medial malleolus, was left intact.  This pedicle was the anterior portion of the deltoid ligament.  At this time, a MicroChoice saw was then used to make a box osteotomy of the medial malleolus.  Once this was performed, the medial malleolus was retracted anterolaterally with its remaining pedicle intact for later blood supply.  This provided us with excellent exposure to the fracture site of the medial side.  At this time, any loose comminuted pieces were removed.  The dome of the talus was also checked and did not reveal any osteochondral defects.  There was some comminution on the dorsal aspect of the complete talus fracture and we were concerned that once we place the screw, this would tend to extend the fracture site.  It is for this reason, we did the medial malleolar osteotomy to prevent this from happening in order to best expose the fracture site.  At this time, a reduction was performed.  The #7-0 partially threaded cannulated screws were used in order to fix the fracture.  At this time, a 3.2 mm guidewire was placed going from posterolateral to anteromedial.,This was placed slightly lateral to the Achilles tendon, percutaneously inserted, and then drilled in the according fashion across the fracture site.  Once this was performed, a skin knife was then used to incise over the percutaneous insertion in order to accommodate the screw going in.  A depth gauze was then used to measure screw length.  A cannulated drill was then used to drill across the fracture site to allow the entrance of the screw.  A 55 mm partially threaded #7-0 cannulated screw was then placed with excellent compression at the fracture site.  Once this was obtained, we checked the reduction again using intraoperative Xi-Scan in the AP and lateral direction.  This projection gave us excellent view of our screw placement and excellent compression across the fracture site.  At this time, we bone grafted the area of comminution using 1 cc of DynaGraft with crushed cancellous allograft.  This was placed using a freer elevator into the fracture site where the comminution was.  At this time, we copiously irrigated the wound.  The osteotomy site was then repaired, first clamped using two large tenaculum reduction clamps.  Two partially threaded #4-0 cannulated screws were then used to fix the osteotomy site and anatomical reduction was performed with excellent compression across the osteotomy site with the two screws.  Next, a #1-0 Vicryl was then used to repair the deltoid ligament, which was ruptured via the injury.  A tight repair was performed of the deltoid ligament.  At this time, again copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  A #2-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the subcutaneous skin and staples for the skin incision.  At this time, the leg was cleansed, Adaptic, 4 x 4, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a plaster splint for mobilization.  The tourniquet was then released.  The patient was then transferred off the operating table to recovery in stable condition.  The prognosis for this fracture is guarded.  There is a high rate of avascular necrosis of the talar body, approximately anywhere from 40-60% risk.  The patient is aware of this and he will be followed as an outpatient for this problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

There was a great deal of inflammatory reaction around the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was slightly larger.  There was a stone impacted in the cystic duct with the gallbladder.  The gallbladder contained numerous stones which were small.  With the stone impacted in the cystic duct, it was felt that probably none were within the common duct.  Other than rather marked obesity, no other significant findings were noted on limited exploration of the abdomen.,PROCEDURE:,  Under general anesthesia after routine prepping and draping, the abdomen was insufflated with the Veress needle, and the standard four trocars were inserted uneventfully.  Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered.,After limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out.  This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct.  In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out.  Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct.  The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed.  Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction.  The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding.  The gallbladder was extracted through the operating trocar site, and the trocar was reinserted.  Inspection was made of the gallbladder bed.

The block was performed at 8 o'clock as well with 5 ml at 10 and 2 o'clock.  The lidocaine was injected into the cervix.  The cervix was minimally dilated with #17 Hanks dilator.  The 5-mm 30-degree hysteroscope was then inserted under direct visualization using lactated Ringer's as a distention medium.  The uterine cavity was viewed and the above normal findings were noted.  The Essure tubal occlusion was then inserted through the operative port and the tip of the Essure device easily slid into the right ostia.  The coil was advanced and easily placed and the device withdrawn.  There were three coils into the uterine cavity after removal of the insertion device.  The device was removed and reloaded.  The advice was to advance under direct visualization and the tip was inserted into the left ostia.  This passed easily and the device was inserted.  It was removed easily and three coils again were into the uterine cavity.  The hysteroscope was then removed and the ThermaChoice ablation was performed.  The uterus was then sounded to 9.5 to 10 cm.  The ThermaChoice balloon was primed and pressure was drawn to a negative 150.  The device was then moistened and inserted into the uterine cavity and the balloon was slowly filled with 40 ml of D5W.  The pressure was brought up to 170 and the cycle was initiated.

"PROBLEM:  ,Prescription evaluation for Crohn's disease., ,HISTORY: , This is a 46-year-old male who is here for a refill of Imuran.  He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.

Slightly low H&H., ,PLAN:  ,1.  We discussed Dr. S's recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms.  The patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  The patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  He states understanding of this. Advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. ,2.  Continue with liver panel and ABC every month per Dr. S's instructions.,3.  Continue Imuran 100 mg per day.,4.  Continue to minimize Tylenol use.  The patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not Tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  Dr. S is consulted and agrees that Imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. The patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. ,5.  Reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  Encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter H2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  The patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for Zantac 150 mg per day will be provided.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard inguinal incision was made and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel, and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle.  This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.  Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.,The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures.  The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Nissen fundoplication.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.,The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The,52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Subsequent monitored anesthesia care was administered.  The C-arm was brought into the operative field and an AP view of the lumbar spine was obtained with particular attention to the C5-6 level.  The neck area was then prepped with Betadine solution and draped sterile.  A metallic marker was placed over the C5-6 lamina and a skin wheal was raised in the skin.  A #20-gauge Tuohy needle was then advanced into the spinal canal using 1% Xylocaine anesthetic and the depth of penetration to the C5 lamina was determined.  The needle was redirected into the interlaminar space and advanced to the previously determined level.  A 10 cc syringe was then placed onto the end of the needle and, using an air-negative technique, the needle was advanced into the epidural space.  When a free flow of air was produced, a solution of 80 mg Depo-Medrol, 2 cc of 1% Xylocaine injectable, and 5 cc of normal saline was then injected into the epidural space.  The Tuohy needle was removed.  Betadine was cleansed from the skin.  A bandage was placed over the needle entrance point.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  PICC line insertion.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was identified by myself on presentation to the angiography suite.  His right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion from the antecubital fossa up.  Under ultrasound guidance, a #21-gauge needle was placed into his right cephalic vein.  A guidewire was then threaded through the vein and advanced without difficulty.  An introducer was then placed over the guidewire.  We attempted to manipulate the guidewire to the superior vena cava; however, we could not pass the point of the subclavian vein and we tried several maneuvers and then opted to do a venogram.  What we did was we injected approximately 4 mL of Visipaque 320 contrast material through the introducer and did a mapping venogram and it turned out that the cephalic vein was joining into the subclavian vein.  It was very tortuous area.  We made several more attempts using the mapping system to pass the glide over that area, but we were unable to do that.  Decision was made at that point then to just do a midline catheter.  The catheter was cut to 20 cm, then we inserted back to the introducer.  The introducer was removed.  The catheter was secured by two #3-0 silk sutures.  Appropriate imaging was then taken.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure nicely and was discharged from Angiography in satisfactory condition back to the general floor.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, coronary angiogram.,2.  PCI of the LAD and left main coronary artery with Impella assist device.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , Unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired LV function.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 7-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  Through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  Thereafter, 6-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  Thereafter, a 4-French sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch J-wire into the left ventricle and LV-gram was performed in RAO view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the LAO view.  Therefore, a 6-French JL4 and JR4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  ,1.  LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.,2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,INTERVENTION: , After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,RESULTS: , Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.

"PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement.,2. Left ventricular angiography was not performed.,3. Right posterior descending artery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty followed by stenting.,4. Right femoral artery angiography.,5. Perclose to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:, Patient presenting with a history of coronary artery disease in the past with coronary angiography in the early 1990s. The patient presented with what appeared to be a COPD exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme markers suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure was performed. The patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, The opening aortic pressure was 91/63. The left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant.,CONCLUSION:, Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA.,The case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion was crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications.,ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION:, Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA.,RECOMMENDATIONS:, Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no less than six months.

Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , New-onset seizure.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Pneumatosis coli in the cecum.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted on 10/27/07 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia.  The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Obtained from the medical chart.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Per his current medical chart.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago.

He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.,DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.,PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As you know she is a 51-year-old lady who was found to have a creatinine of 2.4 on a recent hospital admission to XYZ Hospital.  She had been admitted at that time with chest pain and was subsequently transferred to University of A and had a cardiac catheterization, which did not show any coronary artery disease.  She also was found to have a urinary tract infection at that time and this was treated with ciprofloxacin.  Her creatinine both at XYZ Hospital and University of A was elevated at 2.4.  I do not have the results from the prior years.  A repeat creatinine on 08/16/06 was 2.3.

A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism.  A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct.  Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today.  He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow.  Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication.

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Breast reconstruction post mastectomy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 51-year-old lady, who had gone many years without a mammogram when she discovered a lump in her right breast early in February of this year.  She brought this to the attention of her primary care doctor and she soon underwent ultrasound and mammogram followed by needle biopsy, which revealed that there was breast cancer.  This apparently was positive in two separate locations within the suspicious area.  She also underwent MRI, which suggested that there was significant size to the area involved.  Her contralateral left breast appeared to be uninvolved.  She has had consultation with Dr. ABC and they are currently in place to perform a right mastectomy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Positive for hypertension, which is controlled on medications.  She is a nonsmoker and engages in alcohol only moderately.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history includes uterine fibroids, some kind of cyst excision on her foot, and cataract surgery.,ALLERGIES: , None known.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, ramipril, Lasix, and potassium.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, the patient is a healthy looking 51-year-old lady, who is moderately overweight.  Breast exam reveals significant breast hypertrophy bilaterally with a double D breast size and significant shoulder grooving from her bra straps.  There are no any significant scars on the right breast as she has only undergone needle biopsy at this point.  Exam also reveals abdomen where there is moderate excessive fat, but what I consider a good morphology for a potential TRAM flap.,IMPRESSION:,  A 51-year-old lady for mastectomy on the right side, who is interested in the possibility of breast reconstruction.  We discussed the breast reconstruction options in some detail including immediate versus delayed reconstruction and autologous tissue versus implant reconstruction.  I think for a lady of this physical size and breast morphology that the likelihood of getting a good result with a tissue expander reconstruction is rather slim.  A further complicating factor is the fact that she may well be undergoing radiation after her mastectomy.  I would think this would make a simple tissue expander reconstruction virtually beyond the balance of consideration.  I have occasionally gotten away with tissue expanders with reasonable results in irradiated patients when they are thinner and smaller breasted, but in a heavier lady with large breasts, I think it virtually deemed to failure.  We therefore, mostly confine our discussion to the relative merits of TRAM flap breast reconstruction and latissimus dorsi reconstruction with implant.  In either case, the contralateral breast reduction would be part of the overall plan., ,The patient understands that the TRAM flap although not much more lengthy of a procedure is a little comfortable recovery.  Since we are sacrificing a rectus abdominus muscle that can be more discomfort and difficulties in healing both due to it being a respiratory muscle and to its importance in sitting up and getting out of bed.  In any case, she does prefer this option in order to avoid the need for an implant.  We discussed pros and cons of the surgery, including the risks such as infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen.  We also discussed some of the potential flap complications including partial or complete necrosis of the TRAM flap itself.,PLAN: , The patient is definitely interested in undergoing TRAM flap reconstruction.  At the moment, we are planning to do it as an immediate reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy.  For this reason, I have made arrangements to do initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of days.  We may cancel this if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high.  If this is the case, I think we can do a better job on the reconstruction if we defer it.  The patient understands this and will proceed according to the recommendations from Dr. ABC and from the oncologist.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old gentleman, who works offshore as a cook, who about 4 days ago noted that he was having some swelling in his ankles and it progressively got worse over the past 3 to 4 days, until he was swelling all the way up to his mid thigh bilaterally.  He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.  He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.,General:  He was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles intact.,Neck:  Supple.  No JVD, adenopathy, or bruit.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without a rub.,Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.,Extremities:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis.  He did have 2+ pretibial edema in both lower extremities.,Neurologic:  No gross focal findings.,Skin:  Showed no active skin lesions.,LABORATORY DATA: , Sodium 138, potassium 6.1, chloride 108, CO2 22, glucose 116, BUN 111, creatinine 7.29, estimated GFR 10 mL/minute.  Calcium 7.4 with an albumin of 1.9.  Mag normal at 2.2.  Urine culture negative at 12 hours.  His Random urine sodium was low at 12.  Random urine protein was 4756, and creatinine in the urine was 538.  Urine drug screen was unremarkable.  Troponin was within normal limits.  Phosphorus slightly elevated at 5.7.  CPK level was 234, white blood cells 6.5, hemoglobin 12.2, platelet count 188,000 with 75% segs.  PT 10.0, INR 1.0, PTT at 27.3.  B-natriuretic peptide 718.  Urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 4+ blood, negative nitrites, and trace leukocytes, 5 to 10 wbc's, greater than 100 rbc's, occasional fine granular casts, and moderate transitional cells.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.,2.  Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with Kayexalate.,3.  Microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.,4.  Hypertension.,PLAN: , I will give him Kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  I will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to ABCD Center per the patient and his wife's request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  We will get a BMP, phosphorus, mag, CBC in the morning since he was given 80 mg of Lasix for fluid retention.  We will also give him 10 mg of Zaroxolyn p.o.  Discontinue all IV fluids.  Check an ANCA hepatitis profile, C3 and C4 complement levels along with CH 50 level.  I did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at Ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  I do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis.,I appreciate consult.  I did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Acute renal failure.,HISTORY: , Limited data is available; I have reviewed his admission notes. Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly. A suggestion of hypertensive disease versus BPH, he was on terazosin. Suggestion of CHF versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with Lasix. He was iron, I presume for anemia. He was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, OTHER PHYSICIAN'S NOTES INDICATE NO KNOWN ALLERGIES.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Not available.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Not available.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Not available.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: An older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.,HEENT: Male pattern baldness. Pupils equally round, no icterus. Intubated. OG tube in place.,NECK: Not tested for suppleness, no carotid bruits are heard. Neck vein distention is not seen.,LUNGS: He has diffuse expiratory wheezing anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly. I would describe the wheezes as coarse. I hear no present rales. Breath sounds otherwise are symmetrical.,HEART: Heart tones regular to auscultation, currently without audible rub or gallop sounds.,BREASTS: Not enlarged.,ABDOMEN: On plane. Bowel sounds presently are normal. Abdomen, I believe, is soft on plane, normal bowel sounds, no bruits, no liver edge felt, no HJR, no spleen tip, no suprapubic fullness.,GU: Catheter draining a dark yellow urine.,EXTREMITIES: Very edematous. Pulses not palpable. Cyanosis not observed. Fungal changes are not observed.,NEUROLOGICAL: Not otherwise assessed.,LABORATORY DATA:, Reviewed.,IMPRESSION:,1. Acute renal failure, suspected. Likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. He also reportedly was on Lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.,2. Multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.,3. I am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum CK recorded is 1500.,4. Antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.,5. Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. Recorded I's are substantially O's during the course of the hospitalization, I presume as part of his resuscitation effort. No central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available. I will follow with you. No present indication for hemodialysis. Antimicrobials are being handled by others.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"REASON FOR CT SCAN: , The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008.  I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.,CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm.  The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm.  There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle.  He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0.,PLAN: , I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"REASON FOR EVALUATION: , The patient is a 37-year-old white single male admitted to the hospital through the emergency room.  I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital.  He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there.  He started having thoughts about killing his mother.  He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years.  He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions.  He was using drugs and smoking marijuana at that time has experimenting with LXV and another drugs too.  The patient has not used any drugs since age 25.  However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts.  I have seen him now for approximately one year.  He has been quite refractory to treatment.  We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary.  The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days.  The dosages that we have used have been very high.  He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level.  However, he has not responded.,He has delusions of antichrist.  He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals.  He has paranoid delusions.  He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now.  He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.,With typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus.  However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa.  The patient has chronic bronchitis.  He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.,DRUG HISTORY:,  He stopped using drugs when he was 25.  He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then.  As mentioned before, he smokes cigarettes quite heavily and which has been a problem for his health since he also has chronic bronchitis.,PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS: , The patient lives with his mother and has been staying with her for a few years now.  We have talked to her.  She is very supportive.  His only sister is also very supportive of him.  He has lived in the ABCD houses in the past.  He has done poorly in some of them.,MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:,  The patient appeared alert, oriented to time, place, and person.  His affect is flat.  He talked about auditory hallucinations, which are equivocal in nature.  He is not homicidal in the hospital as he was when he was at home.  His voice and speech are normal.  He believes in telepathy.  His memory appears intact and his intelligence is calculated as average.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Schizophrenia.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  History of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and chronic bronchitis.,AXIS IV:  Moderate.,AXIS V:  GAF of 35 on admission.,INITIAL TREATMENT AND PLAN:,  Since, the patient has been on high dosages of medications, we will give him a holiday and a structured environment.  We will put him on benzodiazepines and make a decision anti-psychotic later.  We will make sure that he is safe and that he addresses his medical needs well.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  Chest pain, possible syncopal spells.,She is a very pleasant 31-year-old mother of two children with ADD.,She was doing okay until January of 2009 when she had a partial hysterectomy.  Since then she just says ""things have changed"".  She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same.  Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband.  Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.,In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel ""like cramps"" and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long.  She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand.  She has also had three spells of ""falling"", she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.  Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store.  She suffered no trauma.  She has no remote history of syncope.  Her weight has not changed in the past year.,MEDICATIONS: , Naprosyn, which she takes up to six a day.,ALLERGIES:,  Sulfa.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink.

Extremities:  No edema and good distal pulses.,EKG: , Normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG.,ECHOCARDIOGRAM (FOR SYNCOPE): , Essentially normal study.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal.  I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good.  I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night.  I think this should take care of the problem.  I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study.,2.  Chest pains - Atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors.  The Naprosyn is not helping that much, I gave her a prescription for Flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it).,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.

"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began ""as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was ""too derogatory.""  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.""  It concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot ""like dragging.""  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.

He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Followup 4 months status post percutaneous screw fixation of a right Schatzker IV tibial plateau fracture and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures treated nonoperatively.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who is now approximately 4 months status post percutaneous screw fixation of Schatzker IV tibial plateau fracture and nonoperative management of second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.  He is currently at home and has left nursing home facility.  He states that his pain is well controlled.  He has been working with physical therapy two to three times a week.  He has had no drainage or fever.  He has noticed some increasing paresthesias in his bilateral feet but has a history of spinal stenosis with lower extremity neuropathy.,FINDINGS: , On physical exam, his incision is near well healed.  He has no effusion noted.  His range of motion is 10 to 105 degrees.  He has no pain or crepitance.  On examination of his right foot, he is nontender to palpation of the metatarsal heads.  He has 4 out of 5 strength in EHL, FHL, tibialis, and gastroc-soleus complex.  He does have decreased sensation to light touch in the L4-L5 distribution of his feet bilaterally.,X-rays taken including AP and lateral of the right knee demonstrate a healed medial tibial plateau fracture status post percutaneous screw fixation.  Examination of three views of the right foot demonstrates the second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.  These appear to be extraarticular.  They are all in a bayonet arrangement, but there appears to be bridging callus between the fragments on the oblique film.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Four months status post percutaneous screw fixation of the right medial tibial plateau and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.,PLANS: , I would like the patient to continue working with physical therapy.  He may be weightbearing as tolerated on his right side.  I would like him to try to continue to work to gain full extension of the right knee and increase his knee flexion.  I also would like him to work on ambulation and strengthening.,I discussed with the patient his concerning symptoms of paresthesias.  He said he has had the left thigh for a number of years and has been followed by a neurologist for this.  He states that he has had some right-sided paresthesias now for a number of weeks.  He claims he has no other symptoms of any worsening stenosis.

"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson's disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.,He does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.,REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the ,75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.,Spine:  The spine is straight and not tender.  I can easily palpate the spinous processes.  There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.  Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.,Cerebellar Exam:  Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  There is no dysarthria.,Reflexes:  Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.,Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology.  It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).,3.  Gait impairment (781.2).,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).,5.

"REASON FOR VISIT: , Acute kidney failure.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 68-year-old Korean gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes and stage III CKD with a creatinine of 1.8 in May 2006 corresponding with the GFR of 40-41 mL/min.  The patient had blood work done at Dr. XYZ's office on June 01, 2006, which revealed an elevation in his creatinine up to 2.3.  He was asked to come in to see a nephrologist for further evaluation.  I am therefore asked by Dr. XYZ to see this patient in consultation for evaluation of acute on chronic kidney failure.  The patient states that he was actually taking up to 12 to 13 pills of Chinese herbs and dietary supplements for the past year.  He only stopped about two or three weeks ago.  He also states that TriCor was added about one or two months ago but he is not sure of the date.  He has not had an ultrasound but has been diagnosed with prostatic hypertrophy by his primary care doctor and placed on Flomax.  He states that his urinary dribbling and weak stream had not improved since doing this.  For the past couple of weeks, he has had dizziness in the morning.  This is then associated with low glucose.  However the patient's blood glucose this morning was 123 and he still was dizzy.  This was worse on standing.  He states that he has been checking his blood pressure regularly at home because he has felt so bad and that he has gotten under 100/60 on several occasions.  His pulses remained in the 60s.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Imdur 20 mg two to three times daily, nitroglycerin p.r.n., insulin 70/30 40/45 units daily, Zetia 10 mg daily, ?

No drug abuse.  He quit tobacco and alcohol 15 years ago.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Parents both died in Korea.  Has one sister with hypertension and the other sister lives in Detroit and is healthy.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has lost about 10 pounds over the past month.  He has been fatigue and weak with no appetite.  He has occasional chest pain and dyspnea on exertion on fast walking.  His lower extremity edema has improved with higher doses of furosemide.  He does complain of some early satiety.  He complains of urinary frequency, nocturia, weak stream and dribbling.  He has never passed the stone.  He gets dizzy when his blood sugars are in the 40s to 60s but now this is continuing with him running, glucose is in the 120s.  He has some right back pain today and complains of farsightedness.  The remainder of review of systems is done and negative per the patient.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 78.  Blood pressure 116/60.  Height 5'7"" per the patient.  Weight 78.6 kg.  Supine pulse 60 with blood pressure 128/55.  Standing pulse 60 with blood pressure of 132/50.  GENERAL:  He is in no apparent distress, but he is dizzy on standing for prolonged period.

No synovitis, arthritis or gait disturbance.  SKIN:  Old scars in his low back as well as his left lower extremity.  No active rashes, purpura or petechiae.  Midline sternotomy scar is well healed.  NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Reflexes are poor to 1+ bilaterally.  10 g monofilament sensation is intact except for the big toes bilaterally.  No asterixis.  Finger-to-nose testing is intact.  PSYCHIATRIC:  Fully alert and oriented.,LABORATORY DATA:,  December 2004, creatinine was 1.5.  Per report May 2006, creatinine was 1.8 with a BUN of 28.  Labs dated 06/01/06, hematocrit was 32.3, white blood cell count 7.2, platelets 263,000, sodium 139, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, CO2 25, BUN 46, creatinine 2.3, glucose 162, albumin 4.7, LFTs are normal.  CK was elevated at 653.  A1c is 7.6%.  LDL cholesterol is 68, HDL is 35.  Urinalysis reveals microalbumin to creatinine ratio 59.8.  UA was otherwise negative with a pH of 5.  Today his urinalysis showed specific gravity 1.020, negative glucose, bilirubin, ketones and blood, 30 mg/dL of protein, pH of 5, negative nitrates, leukocyte esterase.  Microscopic exam was bland.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Acute on chronic kidney failure.  He has underlying stage III CKD with the GFR approximately 41 mL/min.  He has episodic hypotension at home and low diastolic pressure here.  His weight is down 2 to 3 Kg from June and he may be prerenal.  He also has a history of prostatic hypertrophy and obstruction must be investigated.  I am also concerned about his use of Chinese herbs which can cause chronic interstitial nephritis.  There is no evidence of pyuria today although this can present with a fairly bland sediment.  An additional concern is that TriCor can cause an artifactual increase in the creatinine due to changes in metabolism.  I think this would be a diagnosis of exclusion.,2.  Orthostatic hypotension.  He is maintaining systolic but his diastolic pressures are gotten in to a point where he may not be perfusing his brain well.,3.  Elevated creatine kinase consistent with myositis.  It could be a result of Crestor alone or combination of TriCor and Crestor.  I do not think this is enough to cause rhabdomyolysis, however.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  The patient was cautioned about using NSAIDs and told to avoid any further Chinese herbs.,2.  Recheck labs including CBC with differential, SPEP, uric acid and renal panel.,3.  Decrease atenolol to 25 mg daily.,4.  Decrease enalapril to 10 mg daily.,5.  Decrease Lasix to 20 mg daily.,6.  Stop Crestor.,7.  Check renal ultrasound.,8.

I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.

Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.,An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.,Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"REASON FOR VISIT:,  This 48-year-old woman returns in followup after a full-night sleep study performed to evaluate her for daytime fatigue and insomnia.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient presented initially to the Pulmonary Clinic with dyspnea on minimal exertion.  At that time, she was evaluated and found to have evidence for sleep disruption and daytime fatigue.  She also complained of nocturnal choking episodes that have since abated over the past several months.  In the meantime, she had been scheduled for an overnight sleep study performed to evaluate her for sleep apnea, returns today to review her study results.,The patient's sleep patterns consist of going to bed between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. and awakening in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.  She reports difficulty in initiating sleep and then recurrent awakenings every 1 to 2 hours throughout the night.  She reports tossing and turning throughout the night and awakening with the sheets in disarray.  She reports that her sleep was much better quality in the sleep laboratory as compared to home.  When she awakens, she might have a dull headache and feels tired in the morning.  Her daughter reports that she has heard the patient talking during sleep and snoring.  There are no apneic episodes.  The patient reports that she used to cough a lot in the middle of the night, but has no longer been doing so in recent weeks.,During the daytime, the patient reports spending a lot of sedentary time reading and watching TV.

Diffusing capacity is well preserved.,An overnight sleep study was performed on this patient at the end of 02/07.  At that time, she reported that her sleep was better in the laboratories compared to home.  She slept for a total sleep time of 398 minutes out of 432 minutes in bed (sleep proficiency 92 percent).  She fell asleep in the middle of latency of less than 1 minute.  She woke up after sleep onset of 34 minutes.  She had stage I sleep that was some elevated at 28 percent of total sleep time, and stage I sleep is predominantly evident in the lateral portion of the night.  The remainders were stage II at 69 percent, stage III and IV at 3 percent of total sleep time.,The patient had no REM sleep.,The patient had no periodic limb movements during sleep.,The patient had no significant sleep-disordered breathing during non-REM sleep with less than one episode per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturation remained in the low to mid 90s throughout the night.,Intermittent inspiratory flow limitation compatible with snoring was observed during non-REM sleep.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This patient presents with history of sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness with fatigue.  Her symptoms are multifactorial.,Regarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, the patient has a component of psychophysiologic insomnia, based on reports of better sleep in the laboratory as compared to home.  In addition, nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruption.,Regarding her daytime sleepiness, the patient is taking a number of long-acting central nervous system acting medications to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime.  These include trazodone, Seroquel, and methadone.  Of these medications, the methadone is clearly indicative, given the history of substance abuse.  It would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with Seroquel.  I brought this possibility up with the patient, and I asked her to discuss this further with her psychiatrist.,Finally, to help mitigate sleep disruption at night, I have provided her with tips for sleep hygiene.  These include bedtime rituals, stimulus control therapy, and sleep restriction as well as avoidance of nicotine in the evening hours.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Risks that were discussed included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  Percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was then performed.  A wire was then advanced in the left axillary vein using fluoroscopy.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was then administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the previously placed guidewire, a 7-French sidearm sheath was advanced over the wire into the vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down in the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Lead was passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in an apical septal location.  This was an active fixed lead and the screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  The suture sleeve was then advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  A pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the lead.  The lead was then carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator, and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  Pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  No acute complications were noted.,DEVICE DATA,1.

"SINGLE CHAMBER PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mobitz type II block with AV dissociation and syncope.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mobitz type II block, status post single chamber pacemaker implantation, Boston Scientific Altrua 60, serial number 123456.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Left subclavian access under fluoroscopic guidance.,2.  Left subclavian venogram under fluoroscopic evaluation.,3.  Insertion of ventricular lead through left subclavian approach and ventricular lead is Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 123456.,4.  Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, Altrua, serial number 123456.,5.  Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.,Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.,The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.,The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.,After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.,At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.,After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.,The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456.  After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.,The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.,No significant bleeding noticed.,CONCLUSION:  ,Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.

"SUBJECTIVE:  ,This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.  ,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  General:  With this illness he has had no problems with fever.  HEENT:  Some runny nose, more runny nose than congestion.  Respiratory:  Denies shortness of breath.  Skin:  He has a peeling skin on the bottom of his feet, mostly the right foot that he is talking about today.  At times it is itchy.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 238.4 pounds, blood pressure 128/74, temperature 97.8, pulse 80, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.  Skin exam:  I checked out the bottom of his right foot.  He has peeling skin visible consistent with tinea pedis.  On the anterior aspect of the right third finger there is a small little raised up area that I believe represents a wart.  The size of this wart is approximately 3 mm in diameter.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Upper respiratory tract infection, persistent.,2.  Tinea pedis.,3.  Wart on the finger.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.,5.  Tobacco abuse.,PLAN: , The patient is getting a refill on Allegra-D.  I am giving him a refill on the Nizoral 2% cream that he should use to the foot area twice a day.  I gave him instructions on how to keep the foot clean and dry because I think the reason we are dealing with this persistent problem is the fact that his feet are hot and sweaty a lot because of his work.  His wart has been present for some time now and he would like to get it frozen.  I offered him the liquid nitrogen treatment and he did agree to it.  I used liquid nitrogen after a verbal consent was obtained from the patient to freeze the wart.  He tolerated the procedure very well.  I froze it once and I allowed for a 3 mm freeze zone.  I gave him verbal wound care instructions after the procedure.  Lastly, when he is fasting I am going to send him to the lab with a slip, which I gave him today for a basic metabolic profile, CBC, fasting lipid profile, and a screening PSA test.  Lastly, for the upper respiratory tract infection, I am giving him amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 10 days.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient has recently had an admission for pneumonia with positive blood count.  She was treated with IV antibiotics and p.o. antibiotics; she improved on that.  She was at home and doing quite well for approximately 10 to 12 days when she came to the ER with a temperature of 102.  She was found to have strep.  She was treated with penicillin and sent home.  She returned about 8 o'clock after vomiting and a probable seizure.  Temperature was 104.5; she was lethargic after that.  She had an LP, which was unremarkable.

"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.

Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.

Pedal pulses 2+.  Her right second and third toes lay on each other.  Also, the same on her left foot.  However, there was no skin breakdown.  She had large bunions, medial aspect of the ball of both feet.  She had positive sensitivity to most areas of her feet, however, she had negative sensitivity to the medial and lateral aspect of the balls of her left foot.,During the education session, she set behavioral goals for self care.  First goal is to eat three meals a day and eat three snacks daily to improve her blood glucose levels.  Second goal is to eat a well balanced meal at 1200 calories in order to lose one-half pound of weight per week and improve her blood glucose control.  Third goal is to exercise by walking for 15 to 30 minutes a day, three to five days a week to increase her blood glucose control.  Her success in achieving these goals will be followed in three months by a letter from the diabetes education class.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Since she is doing so well with her diet changes, her blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side, especially considering the fact that she has low blood sugar unawareness.

"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient returns to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic for followup evaluation of interstitial disease secondary to lupus pneumonitis.  She was last seen in the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic in January 2004.  Since that time, her respiratory status has been quite good.  She has had no major respiratory difficulties; however, starting yesterday she began with increasing back and joint pain and as a result a deep breath has caused some back discomfort.  She denies any problems with cough or sputum production.  No fevers or chills.  Recently, she has had a bit more problems with fatigue.  For the most part, she has had no pulmonary limitations to her activity.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Synthroid 0.112 mg daily; Prilosec 20 mg daily; prednisone, she was 2.5 mg daily, but discontinued this on 06/16/2004; Plaquenil 200 mg b.i.d.; Imuran 100 mg daily; Advair one puff b.i.d.; Premarin 0.3 mg daily; Lipitor 10 mg Monday through Friday; Actonel 35 mg weekly; and aspirin 81 mg daily.

"She was evaluated this a.m. and was without any significant clinical change.  Her white count has been improving and down to 12,000.  A chest x-ray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates, but no acute cardiopulmonary change.  There was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia.,She has been on Zosyn for the infection.,Throughout her hospitalization, we have been trying to adjust her pain medications.  She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was ""immune"" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.  We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being.  I suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder.,Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission.

"TECHNICAL SUMMARY: , The patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06.  The patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement.  Additional temporal electrodes and single channels of EOG and EKG were also recorded.  The patient's medications valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study.,The occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz and well regulated.  Low voltage 18 to 22 Hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally.,HYPERVENTILATION:  ,There are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing.,PHOTIC STIMULATION:,  There are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light.,SLEEP: , There are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms.,INDUCED EVENT: , On the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event.  The patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure.  At 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation.  Approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated.  Approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning.  Approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed.  She persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping.  Approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name.  When asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event.  When later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home.,EEG: , There are no significant changes to the character of the background EEG activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event.  Of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present.,IMPRESSION:,  The findings of this patient's 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study are within the range of normal variation.  No epileptiform activity is present.  One clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above.

"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Central neck reoperation with removal of residual metastatic lymphadenopathy and thyroid tissue in the central neck.  Left reoperative neck dissection levels 1 and the infraclavicular fossa on the left side.  Right levels 2 through 5 neck dissection and superior mediastinal dissection of lymph nodes and pretracheal dissection of lymph nodes in a previously operative field.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is a 37-year-old gentleman well known to me with a history of medullary thyroid cancer sporadic in nature having undergone surgery in 04/07 with final pathology revealing extrafocal, extrathyroidal extension, and extranodal extension in the soft tissues of his medullary thyroid cancer.  The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease.  Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed.  The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others.  The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon.  The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine.  Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately.  A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip.  The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised.  A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied.  The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left.  Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible.  The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve.  Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric.  The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally.  The mylohyoid muscle appreciated.  The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated.  The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis.  The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure.  Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side.  Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified.  The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified.  The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels.  Attention was then turned to the central neck.  The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline.  There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature.  A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed.  Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side.  This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein.  Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass.  Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis.  Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection.  A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius.  The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland.  A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated.  The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly.  Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified.  The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle.  Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex.  Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization.  The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass.  Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated.  The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly.  The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  No bleeding points identified.  The wound was then prepared for closure.  Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was closed  with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated on the operating room table, and sent to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then was taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination.  The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System.  The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System.  The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique.  Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.

Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring devices were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The right greater saphenous vein was harvested and prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 Surgilon and flushed with heparinized blood.  Hemostasis was achieved in the legs and closed with running 2-0 Dexon in the subcutaneous tissue and running 3-0 Dexon subcuticular in the skin.  Median sternotomy incision was made and the left mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff of the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The pericardium was opened.  The pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula and bypass was instituted.  A retrograde cardioplegic cannula was placed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 Prolene suture in the right atrial wall into the coronary sinus and tied to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegic needle sump combination was placed in the ascending aorta and tied in place with 4-0 Prolene.  The ascending aorta was crossclamped.  Cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given to the ascending aorta followed by sumping through the ascending aorta followed by cold retrograde potassium cardioplegia.  The obtuse marginal coronary artery was identified and opened and end-to-side anastomosis was performed to the reversed autogenous saphenous vein with running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given and the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde potassium cardioplegia were given.  The mammary artery was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  The anterior descending was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed through the left internal mammary artery with running 8-0 Prolene suture.  The mammary pedicle was sutured to the heart with interrupted 5-0 Prolene suture.

"XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
